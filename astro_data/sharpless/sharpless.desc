The Sharpless catalog is a list of 313 H II regions (emission nebulae) intended to be comprehensive north of declination −27°.
(It does include some nebulae south of that declination as well.)

The first edition was published in 1953 with 142 objects (Sh1), and the second and final version was published by US astronomer Stewart Sharpless in 1959 with 312 objects.
Sharpless also includes some planetary nebulae and supernova remnants, in addition to H II regions.
