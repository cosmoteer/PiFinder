Sharpless Index,Description
1,"This combination HII region and reflection nebula is ionised by the B1V class star Pi Scorpii, a member of the nearby Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Sco OB2 association, which forms part of the Gould belt and the inner edge of the Orion spur."
2,"This HII region surrounds the O6.5 Ia supergiant and X-ray eclipsing binary HD 153919. It is seen behind the closer star cluster NGC 6281.HD 153919 is a runaway star ejected from the Sco OB1 star association in a supernova explosion about 2 million years ago."
3,"This bubble, most commonly called RCW 120, is ionised by the O8 V star CGO 439. Distance estimates consistently place it relatively close by (about 1340 pc) in the Sagittarius arm."
4,"Infrared imagery reveals that RCW 121 (Sh 2-4) and RCW 122 lie at the edge of an enormous bubble ionised by the star cluster Havlen-Moffat 1. This cluster is 2-4 million years old and contains the Wolf-Rayet stars WR 87 and WR 89 as well as several O-stars."
5,"This large diffuse nebula lies in the same direction as the Wolf-Rayet star WR 89.Infrared imagery reveals that RCW 123 (Sh 2-5) lies within an enormous bubble ionised by the star cluster Havlen-Moffat 1. This cluster is 2-4 million years old and contains the Wolf-Rayet stars WR 87 and WR 89 as well as several O-stars. Distance estimates place it in the Centaurus arm."
6,"This is NGC 6302, the Bug nebula, the remains of a dying G V class star. You can see an amazing Hubble image of this planetary nebula."
7,"Sh 2-7 is the core of a huge diffuse nebula and is ionised by the B0.2IVe subgiant binary Delta Scorpii, a member of the nearby Sco OB2 association."
8,"This is NGC 6334, the Cat's Paw nebula. This complex of HII regions contains one larger bubble (Gum 63) adjacent to three smaller bubbles (Gum 61, Gum 62 and Gum 64b) in addition to several other partially obscured nebulae and at least eleven major infrared sources that are probably mostly cooler B stars. It lies at the same distance as NGC 6357, the War and Peace nebula, and is separated from it by a dark cloud. Both are near the Sco OB4 association in the Sagittarius arm."
9,"This combination reflection nebula and HII region is ionised by the B1 III variable giant Sigma Scorpii in the nearby Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Sco OB2 association."
10,"This mysterious nebula, catalogued as RCW 130 and Sh 2-10, lies in the direction of the Sco OB4 association. Two Wolf-Rayet stars, WR 86 and WR 88, are visible towards its edge."
11,"The HII region NGC 6357, also called W 22 or the War and Peace Nebula, is ionised by the Pismis 24 and AH03 J1725-34.4 star clusters. Pismis 24 includes the multiple O4 and O4-5 star system [N78] 35 according to a 1984 paper. (SIMBAD gives a cooler O7 III class for this star.)Near by is the Wolf-Rayet star WR 93, which is also a multiple star system with a class O7-9 companion. The Cat's Paw nebula NGC 6334 lies at approximately the same distance and is separated from it by a dark cloud. You can see both nebulae together in this image.An amazing closeup of part of this nebula can be seen in this Hubble image."
12,"This diffuse nebula is ionised by the binary O-star (O7V + O7V) HD 159176 in the star cluster NGC 6383."
13,"This nebula surrounds the O9.5V binary HD 158186, which lies in the direction of the small cluster Antalova 1."
14,"This nebula appears as a faint blue haze in the direction of the constellation Scorpius. There are no significant references in the scientific literature for this object and indeed the BFS catalog removes Sh 2-14 from its revised Sharpless catalog because Blitz, Fich and Stark could not detect it."
15,"This HII region is ionised by the O8 V star HD 161853 and is part of the Sh 2-15 to Sh 2-20 complex of HII regions located in the Sgr OB5 association in the Sagittarius arm. It is the location of the radio source W25."
16,"Sh 2-16 is part of the Sh 2-15 to Sh 2-20 complex of HII regions located in the Sgr OB5 association in the Sagittarius arm. It appears to be ionised by the O9.5 V star LSS 4381."
17,"Sh 2-17 is part of the Sh 2-15 to Sh 2-20 complex of HII regions located in the Sgr OB5 association in the Sagittarius arm.There are no papers suggesting ionising stars for Sh 2-17 and there are no OB stars in this direction in the Reed OB star catalog either. However, the infrared cluster [DB2000] 58 appears to be embedded in the nebula and may contain the ionising stars."
18,"This small nebula is part of the Sh 2-15 to Sh 2-20 complex of HII regions located in the Sgr OB5 association in the Sagittarius arm. It lies next to RCW 140 (Sh 2-19). No ionising stars are cited in the scientific literature but the nebula is believed to contain the infrared cluster [DB2000] 1 which may perhaps contain ionising stars."
19,"This nebula is part of the Sh 2-15 to Sh 2-20 complex of HII regions located in the Sgr OB5 association in the Sagittarius arm."
20,"This nebula is part of the Sh 2-15 to Sh 2-20 complex of HII regions located in the Sgr OB5 association in the Sagittarius arm. It contains the infrared star clusters [DB2000] 5 and [DB2000] 6."
21,"This HII region is located in the galactic bar below the galactic plane and is associated with the infrared star clusters [DB2000] 7, [DB2000] 10, [DB2000] 11 and [DB2000] 12."
22,"This is a ring nebula surrounding the O8 III giant 63 Ophiuchi (HD 162978), which lies at the edge of the Sgr OB1 association in the Sagittarius arm.You can see the full extent of this huge object in this SuperCOSMOS image."
23,"There is nothing significant on this nebula in the scientific literature. It is close to the A4V star 16 Scorpii and may possibly be a faint reflection nebula.Dean Salman has a good image of this object on his Sharpless nebula website.Both Sh 2-23 and Sh 2-24 can be seen together in this IRAS infrared image. Sh 2-24 is the bright ellipse and Sh 2-23 is the much fainter squiggle below and to the right."
24,"The eerie blue glow of MBM 57 is at a distance stretching between 50 and 240 pc, making it one of the closest known molecular clouds.Dean Salman has a good image of this object on his Sharpless nebula website.Both Sh 2-23 and Sh 2-24 can be seen together in this IRAS infrared image. Sh 2-24 is the bright ellipse and Sh 2-23 is the much fainter squiggle below and to the right."
25,"The Lagoon nebula (M8 = NGC 6523-NGC 6530) isa large HII region mainly ionized by two O-class stars, the ultrahot O4V class 9 Sagittarii and the binary HD 165052 (O6.5V + O7.5V). Sharpless also lists 12 B-stars that may also ionise the nebula. It also includes the radio source W 29.The Lagoon nebula is a major feature of the Sgr OB1 association in the Sagittarius arm. It is embedded within a molecular cloud which extends to the star cluster NGC 6530. The Hourglass nebula lies within M8's core. This is a blister-type HII region which has been produced by the O7.5V star Herschel 36.There is a good image of the the Lagoon nebula here and an amazing wide angle image of the whole region that includes the entire RCW 146 complex and the Trifid nebula."
26,"This diffuse nebula is part of the large region of nebulosity near the Trifid nebula that includes RCW 145. No ionising stars for Sh 2-26 are listed in the scientific literature but the nebula clearly surrounds the O9 III giant LS 4511 so this may be the ionising star."
27,"This is an extended HII region around the nearby O9 V star Zeta Ophiuchi. The spectacular bow shock caused by this star as it ploughs through dense dust clouds near the Sco OB2 association can be seen in this infra-red image from the Milky Way Explorer."
28,"This large faint HII region next to the Trifid nebula is ionised by the O9Ib supergiant LS 4551 and the O-class LS 4538, It lies in the direction of the supernova remnant SNR G006.4-00.1 (W 28).You can view a SuperCOSMOS hydrogen-alpha image."
29,"Sh 2-29, Sh 2-31, and Sh 2-32 are a group of three nebulae next to the much larger Lagoon nebula. Sh 2-29 is the largest of the three. This group is combined together in the RCW (RCW 146c) and Gum (Gum 75) catalogs.Avedisova concludes that Sh 2-29 is ionised by the O9 IV subgiant HD 165921."
30,"The Trifid nebula, M 20, is an HII region ionised by the O7.5 class multiple star HD 164492 (with seven known components), which is a member of the star cluster NGC 6514. It is divided into three parts by dust lanes. A blue reflection nebula surrounds the HII region.The Trifid nebula is usually assumed to be part of the Sgr OB1 association in the Sagittarius arm, along with the Lagoon nebula. However, the surprisingly large range of distance estimates for the nebula leaves open the possibility that it lies much further away in the Centaurus arm."
31,"Sh 2-29, Sh 2-31, and Sh 2-32 are a group of three nebulae next to the much larger Lagoon nebula. This group is combined together in the RCW (RCW 146c) and Gum (Gum 75) catalogs.Avedisova lists two ionising stars for Sh 2-31: the O7V+O9V multiple HD 165921 and the B1 V multiple HD 166107."
32,"Sh 2-29, Sh 2-31, and Sh 2-32 are a group of three nebulae next to the much larger Lagoon nebula. This group is combined together in the RCW (RCW 146c) and Gum (Gum 75) catalogs. Also called IC 1274 and LBN 33, Sh 2-32 is near a major gamma ray source and numerous X-ray sources and has embedded OB stars. Avedisova lists two ionising stars, including the B1 V class CD -23 13997."
33,"The faint red glow of the nearby molecular cloud MBM 38.You can view a more detailed image of this nebula here."
34,"This large diffuse HII region, also called LBN 38, is near the Sgr OB1 association and the Lagoon nebula. According to Sharpless, it is associated with the B1 star HD 165516, which Humphreys places in the Sgr OB1 association. Gum also mentions the Wolf-Rayet star WR 111."
35,"Sh 2-35 and Sh 2-37 are part of a 130 thousand solar mass giant molecular cloud. Sh 2-35 appears along the western edge of this cloud. Sharpless connects this nebula to a number of stars, the hottest of which is the B0 IVPE star HD 312973, which Humphreys locates in the Sgr OB7 association.SIMBAD reports that HD 312973 is actually an O-class star."
36,"The faint rusty red glow of nearby giant molecular cloud MBM 39.You can view a more detailed image of this nebula here."
37,"Sh 2-37 lies in the direction of the ionising star cluster Dias 5. It is also known as IC 1283/1284 and the powerful radio source W 34.Sh 2-35 and Sh 2-37 are associated with a 130 thousand solar mass giant molecular cloud and appear to be part of the Sgr OB7 association. Sh 2-37 is visible through a hole in this molecular cloud. This is a very active star formation region.You can find an infrared image of part of this region here, full colour images here and here, and an analysis of the correct names for these objects here."
38,"Sh 2-38 is a tiny nebula that lies in the direction of the edge of the Sgr OB1 association. It has no significant references in the scientific literature and no ionising stars are known in this direction.An obvious bubble appears in this direction in this Spitzer infrared image. It is catalogued as bubble [CPA2006] N4."
39,"Sh 2-39 is a tiny nebula contained within the boundaries of the much larger Sh 2-41 in the direction of the Sgr OB4 association. There is a bubble in this direction in the MSX infrared data.Avedisova concludes that Sh 2-39 is ionised by the B1 III giant HD 167611 and the B2 III giant BD -18 4892 (HD 313050), at a distance of 2670 +/- 150 parsecs. She places the nebula in star formation region 12.46-1.07 along with a water maser and the young stellar object IRAS 18139-1842."
40,"Sh 2-40 appears as several bright knots of nebulosity extending above the much larger nebula Sh 2-41.Avedisova suggests that Sh 2-40 is ionised by the B-class star LSS 4756.The RCW catalog lists the bit of Sh 2-40 that is furthest from the galactic plane as RCW 155a and the brighter bits closer to the galactic plane as RCW 155b."
41,"Sh 2-41 is a large diffuse nebula and a major component of Messier 24, the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud. Although Messier 24 is not a real object (being made up of many objects at different distances), Sh 2-41 is a real HII region surrounding the Sgr OB4 association, which includes the multiple O7 III giant HD 167771. You can see an image of the entire Messier 24 region here."
42,"Sh 2-42 is believed to be the planetary nebula PN G013.3+01.1."
43,"This faint diffuse nebula is close in direction to the suspected supernova remnant GAL 013.1-00.5 and appears to be located in an empty region bordered by the OB regions Sgr OB1, Sgr OB7 and Sct OB3.Avedisova places Sh 2-43 / RCW 156 into star formation region SFR 13.62-0.76 along with two infrared sources and many molecular clouds.No ionising star for Sh 2-43 has been identified in the scientific literature and no ionising star in this direction appears in the Reed catalog or SIMBAD either. The bright star in this image is the K2 III giant HD 167720."
44,"This huge almost circular nebula is very prominent in hydrogen-alpha as can be seen in this SuperCOSMOS image.Avedisova concludes that it is ionised by the O6 V star HD 167633. Humphreys places this star in the Ser OB1 association in the Sagittarius arm. However, several other sources give larger distance estimates, placing this nebula in the Centaurus arm, where it may be part of the Scutum supershell."
45,"This is M 17, the Omega nebula, also called W 38, the Swan nebula, and the Lobster nebula among other names. This nebula is found in the Ser OB1 association.M 17 is ionised by an O4V-O4V double star system (Kleinmann's star) at the core of the massive young cluster NGC 6618 (about one million years old), which contains over 800 stars, including 2 O5V star systems and 100 stars hotter than B9 (by comparison, the Orion nebula contains 8 stars hotter than B9). The total ultraviolet flux is about 25 times higher than for the Orion nebula.A large part of the nebula is hidden by a dark dust lane that runs near the central cluster and splits the main visible nebula (Gum 81a) from two attached nebulae on the other side of the dust lane (Gum 81b - IC 4706 and IC 4707).M 17 is a blister on the side of a much larger giant molecular cloud and star formation region (M 17SW) that contains 30 thousand solar masses of molecular hydrogen.You can see a more detailed image of part of this massive star formation region and view a good overview of this entire region."
46,"This isolated nebula is located well above the galactic plane. Avedisova concludes that it is ionised by the potential runaway O9.5 Iab supergiant HD 165319, which may have been ejected from NGC 6611, the central star cluster of M 16, the Eagle nebula, about 1.8 million years ago."
47,"According to Avedisova, the ionising star for this small nebula is probably the B0.5 III giant star [L85] S47 3."
48,"This nebula may be associated with the Scutum supershell in the Centaurus arm. Avedisova places it in star formation region SFR 16.65-0.34 along with the molecular clouds SYCSW 164, SYCSW 164A and SRBY 52. She concludes that Sh 2-48 is ionised by the O8 V multiple star ADS 11285.The newly discovered dense star cluster Kronberger 25 appears in the same direction as Sh 2-48, although a tentative distance estimate for this cluster of about 2000 parsecs suggests that it may be a foreground object."
49,"This is M 16, the Eagle Nebula. It is part of the W 37 molecular cloud and is ionized by the NGC 6611 star cluster, which is part of the Ser OB1 association in the Sagittarius arm. NGC 6611 is dominated by the massive and superhot O3.5V+O7.5V class multiple star HD 168076, which has 75-80 solar masses and provides about half the ionising radiation for the nebula.There is a much better image of the Eagle nebula here. A region of M 16 was the subject of perhaps the most famous Hubble space telescope image, the 1995 Pillars of Creation."
50,"Sh 2-50 appears in the direction of the Sct OB3 association and the star cluster Dolidze 28, which has the Wolf-Rayet star WR 115 as its central star."
51,"There is an extremely faint diagonal band of nebulosity at this location, which is far below the galactic plane. SIMBAD says that this nebula is also LBN 65. This region is more easily visible in hydrogen-alpha. Sh 2-51 appears to be connected to the lower edge of the blowout ejected from a huge structure of 620 thousand solar masses of gas and dust in the inner galaxy called the Scutum Supershell."
52,"The faint blue glow comes from the planetary nebula also known as Abell 65. It is highly unusual for a planetary nebula because it contains an eclipsing binary central star. See Sh 2-313 for another example of such a blue planetary nebula with a binary central star."
53,"Sharpless notes that Sh 2-53 consists of ""About six detached portions"". The area is prominent at both radio and infrared frequencies.Avedisova places the nebula in the complex star formation region SFR 18.18-0.30, which includes 4 molecular clouds, a methanol maser and at least 4 additional HII regions visible at radio and infrared frequencies.You can view a good black and white hydrogen-alpha image here."
54,"This HII region is ionised by the young NGC 6604 star cluster, which includes the O5-8V+O5-8V+O8I supergiant multiple HD 167971 and the radio source W 35. It lies, unusually, about 70 parsecs above the galactic plane within the Ser OB2 association. Ser OB2 contains over 100 OB stars with a common age of about 5 million years.A good image of this nebula, which looks like a nest (Gum 84) carrying a tiny egg (Gum 85), can be seen here."
55,"This tiny HII region, also called LBN 73, may be part of the Scutum supershell. Sharpless concludes that it is ionised by BD -11 4665. Neither Sharpless nor SIMBAD give a class for this star. The dark nebula immediately below Sh 2-55 is LDN 412.Sh 2-55 is near a large nebular region in hydrogen-alpha that appears to mark the main boundary of the Scutum Supershell."
56,"This HII region is visible in infrared as the luminous water maser GAL 021.88+00.02."
57,"The tiny nebula Sh 2-57 is ionised by the B0.5 III giant BD -8 4623 within the Sct OB2 association in the Sagittarius arm."
58,"No ionising star has been identified in the scientific literature for Sh 2-58, which is prominent in infrared as the bubble [CPA2006] N30 as well as in radio.Avedisova includes Sh 2-58 in the star formation region SFR 23.13+0.55, along with the molecular cloud SYCSW 317 and the compact radio HII region [L89b] 23.115+0.556.Sh 2-57 and Sh 2-58 are visible together in the sky (as shown by this hydrogen-alpha image), divided by the dark nebula LDN 446 and just east of the Scutum Supershell. However, they seem to be located at quite different distances, with Sh 2-58 at about the same distance as the Supershell and Sh 2-57 in front of this region."
59,"No significant references appear in the scientific literature for this nebula, which lies in the approximate direction of the star cluster NGC 6664 and can be seen in hydrogen-alpha as the brightest portion of a much larger nebula at the edge of the Sct OB2 association. The hottest star in the direction of this diffuse nebula is the O6 class HD 172275."
60,"This large nebula is most often named GAL 025.4-00.2 or GAL 025.38-00.18 in the scientific literature. It has a bewildering number of different names in SIMBAD (not all cross-referenced).It may be associated with the radio source W 42.It is visible in infrared as the prominent bubble [CPA2006] N37 and appears to be ionised by an obscured O7 II giant.The radio source W 42 has wildly varying distance estimates (from 13400 parsecs to 2200 parsecs). If the near estimate of 2200 parsecs (which is from a recent paper published in 2000) is accepted, then W 42 is likely part of the Sh 2-60 nebula. Infrared imagery in the same paper shows that W 42 is energised by a massive, dense and young OB star cluster embedded in an obscuring dust cloud in the bottom left part of this image."
61,"This object is sometimes mistaken for a planetary nebula but in fact is a compact HII region ionised by at least 3 B1 stars and embedded in a 23 thousand solar mass molecular cloud.One of these stars, the emission star AS 310, is now believed to be a star cluster according to a SIMBAD note.A slightly more detailed hydrogen-alpha image of this nebula produced using data from SuperCOSMOS is available here."
62,"This tiny nebula is visible against and perhaps embedded in the Aquila Rift complex of dark clouds.Superimposed on this nebula is the B1.5e V Herbig Be star MWC 297.Avedisova includes Sh 2-62 in the star formation region SFR 26.81+3.54, along with MWC 297 and the Aquila Rift dark clouds."
63,"This is the high latitude molecular cloud MBM 159, which is located at a distance of about 220 pc and may form part of the Aquila rift."
64,"This is the W 40 star formation region, also called LBN 90, which is ionised by the three B1V stars W 40 OS 1a, W 40 OS 2a and W 40 OS 3a.It is obscured by the Aquila Rift dust clouds, which are located between W 40 and our solar system. A 2010 paper using the Herschel infrared space telescope argues that the W 40 complex is embedded in the Aquila Rift at a distance of about 260 parsecs.You can see this region much more clearly in this false-colour MSX 8Î¼m infrared A-band image."
65,"This nebula is ionised by the B1 II giant [F89b] S65 4, a star which is not yet in the SIMBAD catalog. Russeil combines together Sh 2-65 and Sh 2-66. Both are seen at radio frequencies to lie at the edge of the massive W 43 complex. (Note that W 43 is believed to be twice as far away however, in the galactic bar region.)"
66,"The exciting star for this HII region is the O9.5 III giant LS IV -02 16.Russeil combines together Sh 2-65 and Sh 2-66. Both are seen at radio frequencies to lie at the edge of the massive W 43 complex. (Note that W 43 is believed to be twice as far away however, in the galactic bar region.)"
67,"Also called LBN 94, this nearby nebula is ionised by the B0.5 V star BD -2 4752."
68,"The expansion of this 30 thousand year old planetary nebula has been halted by the surrounding local gas but the central star has continued to move so as a result the star is no longer at the centre of the nebula."
69,"This compact HII region is ionised by the B0.5 IV subgiant [F89b] S69 2. It is also a radio source and lies at the centre of a prominent infrared bubble."
70,"Although usually classified as an HII region, this peculiar high latitude nebula, also called LBN 102, looks more like a dust cloud in this image, and indeed this object is in the same direction as the small molecular cloud [CB88] 124."
71,"This is an unusual planetary nebula that appears to have a binary central star. The central star is variable with a period of 68 days and appears to be embedded in a dense core nebula."
72,"This relatively large HII region might be ionised by the B0.5 IV star BD +2 3762 according to Forbes, but this is uncertain.This nebula is prominent at radio frequencies as can be seen in this Effelsberg image and this VLA image and lies at the centre of a faint infrared ring as can be seen in MSX.You can find a good visual frequency image here."
73,"This local molecular cloud is also known as LBN 105, MBM 40 and IREC 53. MBM 40 contains 20 to 40 solar masses of gas. There are no signs of star formation. Like several other local molecular clouds, MBM 40 has a pronounced hairpin shape."
74,"This nebula is ionised by the O9V class Sherwood 182 ([F89b] S74 1). It is either at the same distance as the powerful radio source W 50, or sits in front of it, depending upon the authority. Both W 50 and Sh 2-74 can be seen in this radio image. This image suggests that W 50 is a distinct object but might be joined to Sh 2-74 by a spur visible at radio frequencies.The microquasar SS 433 is part of W 50. This bizarre object, also called V1343 Aquilae, is spewing out two jets of material at more than one-quarter the speed of light."
75,"There is very little to report about this faint, obscured nebula located above the galactic plane except that ammonia was detected in this direction in a 1996 study and it is prominent in infrared as can be seen in this MSX image.Sh 2-76 and several other prominent infrared sources are also located in a similar direction suggesting that there is something interesting in this region but there is little in the scientific literature about it. It is also significant that millimetre emission suggests the presence of dense molecular clouds in this direction. In this poster, the region is labeled ""Aquila Rift""."
76,"This nebula, located well above the galactic plane in the direction of the Aquila Rift dust clouds, is dim at visual frequencies but appears as a large bright bubble in infrared, as can be seen in this MSX image, and is also prominent at radio frequencies.The nebula lies in the same approximate direction as the radio source W45, but Westerhout noted that the identification of this radio source with Sh 2-76 was ""probably incorrect"".On the other hand, Avedisova includes W45 and Sh 2-76 together in star formation region SFR 40.44+2.45 along with 5 masers and several other HII regions visible in infrared."
77,"This appears to be ths same as the high velocity cloud [PDS2002] HIPASS HVC 378 = [DBB2002] 106."
78,"This is the old planetary nebula CTSS 3 and lies at a distance of 700 parsecs."
79,"The very faint nebula in the image may be ionised by the B 2.5V class star [F89b] S79 1. Other sources state that at least some of the visual emission in this direction may be associated with the supernova remnant SNR G49.2-0.7 (also called W51C) which is believed to be at a distance of 6 kpc.Avedisova combines Sh 2-79 and W51C in the star formation region SFR 48.96-0.55 along with four infrared sources."
80,"This is a ring nebula surrounding the runaway Wolf Rayet star WR 124, also known as Merrill's star.You can see this nebula in much greater detail in this Hubble image."
81,"Essentially nothing appears in the scientific literature on this nebula, which is located far below the galactic plane.Sh 2-81 can be clearly seen in this WISE infrared image."
82,"This combination HII region and reflection nebula, also called LBN 129 and DG 159, is ionised by the B0.5V star HD 231616. With the current distance estimate, it appears to be near the Vul OB4 association.A more detailed image of this nebula can be found here and a wider scale image here. The person who created the second image calls this the Little Cocoon nebula - but I prefer to think of this pretty region as the Locket nebula as it looks like a heart-shaped locket to me."
83,"This tiny HII region contains the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 13."
84,"This HII region, also called LBN 131, is near in the sky to the Wolf-Rayet star WR 128. Both Sharpless and Avedisova list WR 128 as an ionising star. However, there is some controversy about whether Sh 2-84 is part of the ring nebula surrounding this star or lies at another distance.A look at this region in hydrogen-alpha reveals that although WR 128 lies in this direction, Sh 2-84 appears to be the brightest part of an enormous ring of ionised gas that is not centred on WR 128 but may instead surround the O7.5 I supergiant QZ Sge. Given the size of the ring it may be much closer than the Wolf-Rayet star.It also seems possible that both QZ Sge and WR 128 contribute to the nebulosity seen in this direction and so Sh 2-84 is not a single object."
85,"This very faint nebula is ionised by the B3 V star HD 177347."
86,"The HII region NGC 6820 contains the radio source W55 and is ionised by the star cluster NGC 6823, which is part of the Vul OB1 association. You can view a more detailed visual image here. The true nature of the region is perhaps best understood by viewing this spectacular Spitzer infrared image."
87,"This massive star formation region is associated with a 7000 solar mass molecular cloud and many sources in the far infrared.You can see a good visual image of Sh 2-87 here and the Spitzer space telescope infrared view here."
88,"This nebula associated with the Vul OB1 association consists of three regions - star formation began in a diffuse large nebula Sh 2-88A, then spread to the compact HII region Sh 2-88B1, ionised by an O8.5-9.5 V star, and then finally spread to the ultracompact Sh 2-88B2, ionised by a star dimmer than B0.5 V.Avedisova lists three ionising stars: the O7 V star HD 338916, the O8.5 Ib supergiant HD 338926, and the B0.5 V star LS II +25 09.You can see the Spitzer space telescope infrared view here."
89,"According to a 1989 paper, Sh 2-89 is ionised by two uncatalogued O7 V and B1 V stars. Sh 2-86, Sh 2-87, Sh 2-88 and Sh 2-89 are part of the HI supershell GSH 061+00+51. Sh 2-89 and Sh 2-90 lie at the north-east boundary of the dark nebula LDN 798.You can see the Spitzer infrared image of this nebula here and a detailed IPHAS hydrogen-alpha image here."
90,"Sh 2-90 is a blister on a 60 thousand solar mass molecular cloud and appears to be affected by gas streaming from the Vul OB1 association. It contains a cometary elephant trunk structure on its eastern edge which appears to have originated from a past disturbance from the southwest.A more detailed visible light image of this nebula can be found here and the Spitzer infrared view here."
91,"Sh 2-91, Sh 2-94 and Sh 2-96 are all filaments of the supernova remnant SNR 065.2+05.7, which has a diameter of about 70 parsecs and an age of about 20 thousand years. Avedisova places Sh 2-91 in the star formation region SFR 64.06+4.42, along with the Footprint nebula.The image here shows only a small section of this nebula. You can view a larger and more detailed image of this nebula here."
92,"Sh 2-92 is ionised by the Wolf-Rayet star WR 127, a binary star with an O9V companion.Avedisova adds a second ionising star, the O7 Ib supergiant HD 332755."
93,"Ionised by the O9V star [F89b] S93 1 and contains the infrared star cluster [BDS2003] 16.You can see a Spitzer infrared image here."
94,"Sh 2-91, Sh 2-94 and Sh 2-96 are all filaments of the supernova remnant SNR 065.2+05.7, which has a diameter of about 70 parsecs and an age of about 20 thousand years."
95,"This is the planetary nebula NGC 6842."
96,"Sh 2-91, Sh 2-94 and Sh 2-96 are all filaments of the supernova remnant SNR 065.2+05.7, which has a diameter of about 70 parsecs and an age of about 20 thousand years."
97,"Sh 2-97 is ionised by at least four stars - two B1V, one B0.5V and one with a spectral type between O9V and B0V.MSX appears to reveal a bubble-like structure for Sh 2-97 in infrared."
98,"This is a ring nebula associated with a 3000 solar mass molecular cloud and the Wolf-Rayet star WR 130.It contains the infrared star cluster [BDS2003] 17.A faint ring can be seen in infrared in this MSX image."
99,"This star formation complex is embedded in the massive W58 radio source and molecular cloud, and is catalogued by Avedisova as SFR 70.29+1.60. The region also includes Sh 2-100, 5 masers, and numerous additional radio and infrared sources including 7 HII regions.Available distance estimates suggests that the W58 molecular cloud is located in the Perseus arm.The W58 region can be seen in this MSX infrared image."
100,"This star formation complex is embedded in the massive W58 radio source and molecular cloud, and is catalogued by Avedisova as SFR 70.29+1.60. The region also includes Sh 2-99, 5 masers, and numerous additional radio and infrared sources including 7 HII regions.Sh 2-100 itself consists of two distinct nebulae - K3-50 (W58A) and NGC 6857.Available distance estimates suggests that the W58 molecular cloud is located in the Perseus arm.The W58 region can be seen in this MSX infrared image."
101,"Avedisova lists 6 ionising stars for the Tulip nebula, including the ultrahot O4 I multiple supergiant HD 190429, the O6.5 III giant HD 227018, and the O9.7 I multiple supergiant HD 226868.Humphreys places HD 227018 in the Cyg OB3 association. As you can see from this false colour hydrogen-alpha image, the Tulip nebula is located at the edge of the Cyg OB3 association.The HD 226868 star system is best known because it includes the powerful X-ray source and suspected black hole Cyg X-1.Available distance estimates place the Tulip nebula and Cyg OB3 in the Orion spur, some distance behind the Cygnus X star formation region.You can see the setting for the Tulip nebula in this amazing wide angle image.This MSX image reveals that the Tulip nebula is just a small portion of a much larger nebula visible in infrared."
102,"The faint red arc of nebulosity is almost lost in the glare of the F5Iab supergiant 41 Cygni.Avedisova associates Sh 2-102 with the Lynds dark nebula LDN 844 and places them both in the star formation region SFR 71.40-5.31."
103,"This is the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant, also known as the radio source W78. A small part of this huge 10 thousand year old object is displayed in the image.You can see an image of the entire object in hydrogen-alpha here and in x-rays here."
104,"Lahulla identifies two potential ionising stars: the O5 V [L85] S104 4 = [CGG78] S104 Anon 3 and the B0 V [L85] S104 3.Avedisova gives a slightly cooler O6V class for the main ionising star. She places Sh 2-104 in the star forming region SFR 74.74+0.61 with the star cluster Dolidze 4 and the HII region DWB 14.You can see a good image of this nebula here. Sh 2-104 is prominent in infrared as can be seen in this MSX 8Î¼m image."
105,"NGC 6888, the Crescent nebula, is a wind blown bubble originating from the Wolf-Rayet star WR 136.The Hubble Space Telescope has taken an interesting closeup image of this nebula.A good image of this nebula is here, and amazing wide field images of the whole region in Cygnus are here and here."
106,"Despite its appearance, this is not a planetary nebula, but a bipolar nebula embedded in a giant molecular cloud and star formation region ionised by an O8 star, Sh 2-106 IR. Avedisova catalogs this region as SFR 76.38-0.61, with 49 distinct components, including 4 masers.You can see a radio image of Sh 2-106 here, and a spectacular optical/infrared composite image here.This MSX infrared image shows that Sh 2-106 is embedded in the tip of a much larger pillar of gas and dust."
107,"Very little about this tiny and very faint nebula located well below the galactic plane appears in the scientific literature.Sharpless suggests that Sh 2-107 may be ionised by the B2 class HD 197460. SIMBAD says that this star is actually a B0.5 Ib supergiant and according to this catalog entry, the star has 9.5 +/- 0.2 solar masses and an age of 22.6 +/- 2.7 million years.Humphreys gives a distance estimate of 2000 parsecs for HD 197460 (and a slightly different class of B1 II(N)). This is at the lower limit of the distance estimate for Sh 2-107 so it is indeed conceivable that this star ionises the nebula."
108,"Sh 2-108 is sometimes called the Gamma Cygni nebula because of the foreground appearance of the F8Iab supergiant (also called Sadr). In fact this nebula lies far beyond Gamma Cygni in the depths of the Cygnus X complex of star formation regions.This nebula is also called DWB 63 and is the location of the radio source W66. According to Avedisova, DWB 63 is ionised by Gamma Cygni, the O8 V class HD 229202 and the B2 Ib supergiant HD 193946. Gamma Cygni is now known to be located in the foreground. SIMBAD agrees with the classes for the other two ionising stars.Avedisova includes Sh 2-108 in star formation region SFR 78.18+1.82 along with the supernova remnant DR4, the infrared star cluster [BDB2003] G077.46+01.76 and numerous other nearby HII regions."
109,"Sharpless notes ""The great size and gross filamentary structure of this nebula set it apart from any known HII region ... Evidently this nebula cannot be considered to be a normal HII region"".When we look in the direction of Sh 2-109 we are looking straight down the Orion spur, the major Milky Way structure that also includes our own solar system.Sh 2-109 is not a single HII region but rather a complex of many HII regions visible in our line of sight, many of which are ionized by stars in several Cygnus OB associations connected to the Cygnus X complex of star formation regions.Some of the many nebulae that are part of this region can be seen here."
110,"This nebula, located far below the galactic plane, lies in the same direction as the high latitude HI shell Hu 8, which consists of about 1300 solar masses of gas, is about 900 thousand years old and lies at a distance of between 350-440 pc.This IRAS infrared image appears to show a faint bubble in this direction. Sh 2-110 appears as a bright spot at the edge of the bubble."
111,"Sh 2-111 can be seen clearly in this false colour hydrogen-alpha image as one of the brightest parts of a ridge of faint clouds below the Cygnus X region.There seems to be no significant references to this nebula in the scientific literature."
112,"The ionising star for this nebula is the O8V class multiple BD+45 3216 (SAO 49801).You can view an IPHAS image of this object here. Sh 2-112 is prominent in infrared as can be seen in this MSX image."
113,"Sh 2-113 and Sh 2-114 form, respectively, the southern and northern portions of a filamentary circle that resembles a supernova remnant. However, no supernova remnant appears to be recorded for this location.Examining this region in hydrogen-alpha suggests that these nebulae are joined to the equally mysterious Sh 2-118 and Sh 2-123 in a long ridge of nebulosity south and south-east of Sh 2-117, the North American nebula. Sh 2-113, Sh 2-118 and Sh 2-123 have distance estimates of about 4000 parsecs. If this ridge is also at 4000 parsecs, it must be enormous.This identical structure can be seen in more detail at the bottom left of this radio and far infrared image of the Cygnus region.You can view an image of both Sh 2-113 and Sh 2-114 together at the bottom of this page."
114,"Sh 2-113 and Sh 2-114 form, respectively, the southern and northern portions of a filamentary circle that resembles a supernova remnant.

If this ridge is also at 4000 parsecs, it must be enormous.This identical structure can be seen in more detail at the bottom left of this radio and far infrared image of the Cygnus region.You can view a very good optical image of Sh 2-114 here."
115,"This HII region lies in the same direction as the radio source W71 and is ionised by the O6 Ib supergiant LS III +46 12 which is part of the star cluster Berkeley 90. The cloud surrounding Berkeley 90 (part of which is visible as Sh 2-115) contains 4400 solar masses of gas and dust and is about 30 pc long.Infrared observations reveal a large, complex structure with multiple bubbles as can be seen in this MSX image. The nebula is also prominent at radio frequencies."
116,"Often described as the planetary nebula Abell 71, but a 1991 study by Paris Pismis and colleagues concluded that this object is actually an HII region.Curiously, Pismis' study appears to have been overlooked by other professional astronomers as Abell 71 continues to appear in lists of planetary nebula.The green glow next to it is probably a fault in the infrared photographic plate."
117,"Sh 2-117 is composed of the North American and Pelican nebulae, NGC 7000/IC 5070/IC 5067, which are visible through gaps in the Rift system of dusty giant molecular clouds that separates the Gould Belt from the Cygnus X complex. Sh 2-117 appears to be ionised by the O5V star 2MASS J20555125+4352246. This star is heavily obscured by the dust in the Lynds dark nebula LDN 935, a Rift cloud which lies at a distance of about 520 parsecs in front of Sh 2-117, and appears to divide the North American and Pelican nebulae.The radio source W80 appears in this direction. A 2009 paper concludes that W80 is generated only partly by Sh 2-117 and includes emission from 4 distinct sources located at different distances along the line of sight.Only a small part of this large and relatively close region appears in this image. You can see a better image of this huge nebula here."
118,"Sh 2-118 is one of the largest nebulae in apparent size in the Sharpless catalog, but essentially nothing about it has been published in the scientific literature.Examining this region in hydrogen-alpha suggests that Sh 2-118 is joined to the equally mysterious Sh 2-113, Sh 2-114 and Sh 2-123 in a long ridge of nebulosity south and south-east of Sh 2-117, the North American nebula. Sh 2-114, Sh 2-118 and Sh 2-123 have distance estimates of about 4000 parsecs. If this ridge is also at 4000 parsecs, it must be enormous."
119,"Sh 2-119 is located near the North American nebula (Sh 2-117, NGC 7000). Avedisova lists 6 ionising stars. The hottest of these is the O 7.5 III runaway star 68 Cygni (HD 203064), which was likely blasted out of the Cepheus OB2 association about 5.2 million years ago.It is also known as HS 240 = [GS55] 240. Good colour images of this nebula can be found here and here."
120,"A radio map of Sh 2-120 shows a shell-like structure around a central source. Very little information is available in the literature apart from this map. According to a 1978 study, Sh 2-120, Sh 2-121, Sh 2-127 and Sh 2-128 are all at about the same distance of 7500 parsecs and are ""probably distant HII regions associated with a spiral feature more distant than the Perseus arm"".Sh 2-120 appears behind the much closer dark nebula LDN 988, which has been informally called the Pincushion cloud."
121,"The HII region Sh 2-121 is surrounded by an expanding shell containing about 39 solar masses of gas. The shell is at least 650 thousand year old and is likely driven by stellar winds from an O8.5 class star.According to a 1978 study, Sh 2-120, Sh 2-121, Sh 2-127 and Sh 2-128 are all at about the same distance of 7500 parsecs and are ""probably distant HII regions associated with a spiral feature more distant than the Perseus arm"". A 2003 paper reduces the distance to Sh 2-121 to 4500 Â± 1000 parsecs, which could make it part of the Perseus arm."
122,"Sh 2-122 is likely a reflection nebula illuminated by an embedded but unseen star and associated with the molecular cloud MBM 55, at a distance of 150 pc.A good image of this nearby object can be found here."
123,"Examining this region in hydrogen-alpha suggests that Sh 2-123 is joined to the equally mysterious Sh 2-113, Sh 2-114 and Sh 2-118 in a long ridge of nebulosity south and south-east of Sh 2-117, the North American nebula. Sh 2-114, Sh 2-118 and Sh 2-123 have distance estimates of about 4000 parsecs. If this ridge is also at 4000 parsecs, it must be enormous."
124,"Although very little appears in the scientific literature on the mysterious HII region Sh 2-124, located some distance to the west of the Cep OB1 association, recent detailed hydrogen-alpha imaging done for the IPHAS project reveals the structure of this violin-shaped nebula in spectacular detail.Infrared imaging from MSX reveals a bubble in this direction.Felli and Harten give a list of 5 ionising stars, including the O7.5 class LS III +50 28, and support the BFS distance estimate of 2600 parsecs. However, other sources argue that this star may be too cool to be the ionising star.Chini and Wink identify two uncatalogued ionising stars, with classes O7V and B2V, and give a distance estimate of 3600 parsecs. Crampton, Georgelin and Georgelin give a kinematic distance (based on gas velocity) of 4400 parsecs."
125,"The Cocoon nebula is associated with the star cluster IC 5146 and is ionised by the B0 V class star BD +46 3474 according to Avedisova.This Astronomy Picture of the Day page contains a good large image and links for more information."
126,"This relatively close HII region is also called the 10 Lacertae complex after its ionising star, the O9 V multiple star 10 Lacertae, which forms the core of the Lac OB1 association. The nebula also contains the young Orion type variable emission star LkHA 233."
127,"Radio analysis reveals that Sh 2-127 consists of two distinct components - a larger weaker and more diffuse source (WB89 85A) to the northeast, consistent with ionisation by an O7 class star, and a stronger but smaller source to the southwest (WB89 85B), consistent with ionisation by an O8.5 class star. (However, it is also possible that both components are ionised by a single star.) Both components are located near the northwestern edge of a molecular cloud and are embedded in the molecular gas.According to a 1978 study, Sh 2-120, Sh 2-121, Sh 2-127 and Sh 2-128 are all at about the same distance of 7500 parsecs and are ""probably distant HII regions associated with a spiral feature more distant than the Perseus arm""."
128,"This one million year old HII region is ionised by an O7 star.According to a 1978 study, Sh 2-120, Sh 2-121, Sh 2-127 and Sh 2-128 are all at about the same distance of 7500 parsecs and are ""probably distant HII regions associated with a spiral feature more distant than the Perseus arm""."
129,"Sharpless notes that this large faint nebula is part of the Cep OB2 association and the Cepheus bubble. Avedisova lists 5 B-class ionising stars.Sometimes called the Flying Bat nebula. This image only shows part of this nebula."
130,"This appears to be a reflection nebula.Faint nebulosity surrounds the B5 star HD 197911, the A0 star HD 197809 and the G5 star SAO 18999. HD 197911 is a runaway star blasted from the heart of the Cep OB2 association by a supernova explosion 2-3 million years ago."
131,"Sh 2-131 surrounds the star cluster IC 1396 (also called Trumpler 37, including the O6 multiple HD 206267) and lies in the edge of the Cepheus bubble, the giant expanding shell of gas and dust surrounding the Cep OB2 association.This image only shows a portion of this large nebula. You can see a much better image of Sh 2-131 here, and an image of a famous globule within Sh 2-131, the Elephant Trunk nebula (IC 1396a) here.Sh 2-131 appears at the lower right of the much larger Cepheus bubble as seen in this infrared IRAS image."
132,"This giant HII region, which I call the Dragon nebula, is ionised by two WR stars (WR 152 and WR 153) and OB stars in several embedded clusters. WR 153 and an O 8.5 star lie near the middle of the radio shell associated with this nebula.Available distance estimates locate Sh 2-132 in the Cep OB1 association within the Perseus arm.This nebula is also prominent in radio and infrared images."
133,"Sh 2-133 is probably a part of a chain of ionized arcs surrounding the older group of the Cep OB2 association and is part of the Cepheus bubble."
134,"This HII region is associated with an expanding bubble surrounding Cep OB2. Also associated with this bubble are the HII regions IC 1396 (also called Sh 2-131), Sh 2-129, Sh 2-133, and Sh 2-140.Avedisova concludes that the 40 solar mass O6 Iab supergiant Lam Cep (HD 210839) is the exciting star for Sh 2-134. You can read about the controversy around the origin of this great Milky Way beacon star in the Cep OB2 section of the Clamshell (110Â° - 100Â°) sector portion of the Commentary on the Galactic Plane."
135,"This nebula appears to be a blister on a dark dust cloud in front of the bright arc. The nebula is ionised by the O9.5V class BD+57 2513 and includes the star cluster Juchert 21."
136,"This is a Bok globule, not an HII region. New stars are forming nside the glowing globule, [CB88] 230, within the Lynds dark nebula LDN 1177.Another image of this object can be found here."
137,"This HII region lies at a similar direction and distance as the Cepheus Bubble, a huge expanding shell of gas and dust surrounding the Cep OB2 association.Avedisova identifies 5 ionising stars. The hottest of these is the O9.5 II multiple giant HD 207198."
138,"Embedded in this compact HII region is a large star cluster resembling the Orion Trapezium cluster: it is centrally peaked around several massive stars, and is dense - more than 550 stars at its centre."
139,"According to Avedisova, Sh 2-139 is ionised by two giant stars: LS III +57 38 (O9 III) and LS III +58 37 (B2 III). SIMBAD disagrees with the spectral classification of LS III +57 38, however, and gives it a much cooler spectral class of B5.You can view an IPHAS hydrogen-alpha image of Sh 2-139 here."
140,"Sh 2-140 is part of the Cepheus Bubble, the expanding shell of gas and dust surrounding the Cep OB2 association. The bright rim is created by the B0.5 V double star HD 211880 ionising a Bok globule located within the southwest side of the LDN 1204 molecular cloud.Avedisova identifies three other potential ionising stars, including the O7 V star BD +62 2078. She places Sh 2-140 into the massive star formation region SFR 106.75+5.30, and lists 79 components, including 7 masers and the dark nebulae LDN 1204 and LDN 1206.A good image of Sh 2-140 can be found here."
141,"The faint circular HII region Sh 2-141 lies far away with distance estimates of about 7-8000 parsecs and may be ionised by a single O8 class star."
142,"This HII region, entwined with the star cluster NGC 7380, contains 4000 solar masses of gas and is ionised by the eclipsing binary star DH Cephei (O6+O6). According to a 1994 paper, Sh 2-142 is associated with a molecular cloud containing an additional 6-15 thousand solar masses of gas and is part of the Cep OB1 association.Avedisova adds a second ionising star, the B0 Ib supergiant HD 215806.This beautiful nebula has sometimes been called the Wizard nebula. However, its scalloped edges suggest more of a clamshell to me than a wizard!A very different wider scale image of the same nebula can be found here. You can also see infrared version here and a radio version here."
143,"According to Avedisova, the faint small nebula Sh 2-143 is ionised by the O9.5V star LS III +57 93."
144,"Both Sh 2-144 and Sh 2-146 appear in the direction of the 377 thousand solar mass molecular cloud [UUT2000] Cloud B. Sh 2-144 appears to lie well in front of this cloud, however, and is associated with the local Cepheus clouds.No ionising star for Sh 2-144 has been identified in the scientific literature. Avedisova associates this nebula with the pulsating variable carbon star MV Cep in star formation region 107.66+0.82."
145,"Avedisova identifies 4 ionising stars for Sh 2-145, including two O-stars: the O7 V star BD +62 2078 and the O9 V multiple star HD 213023.Sh 2-145 appears to be part of the Cepheus bubble, the expanding ring of gas and dust surrounding the star cluster NGC 7160 and the Cep OB2 association. The much brighter nebula Sh 2-131 is part of the same structure."
146,"This HII region is split in half by a dust cloud and is ionised by a highly obscured O7 star. It contains the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 34 and appears in the direction of the 377 thousand solar mass molecular cloud [UUT2000] Cloud B."
147,"Avedisova combines Sh 2-147, Sh 2-148 and Sh 2-149 into the star formation region SFR 108.27-1.07, which is ionised by two uncatalogued O8 V and B0 V stars and includes the star cluster King 10 and the young stellar object 2MASX J22555978+5814424.Sh 2-147, Sh 2-148, and Sh 2-149 form one of the two cores of the 105 thousand solar mass molecular cloud [UUT2000] Cloud A. (The other core is associated with Sh 2-152 and Sh 2-153.) This molecular cloud may be interacting with the supernova remnant SNR G109.1-01.0 (CTB 109).The molecular cloud can be seen in this MSX infrared image. The same field at radio frequencies reveals the supernova remnant."
148,"The young dusty HII region Sh 2-148 is ionised by uncatalogued O8 V and B2 V stars according to Pismis.Avedisova combines Sh 2-147, Sh 2-148 and Sh 2-149 into the star formation region SFR 108.27-1.07, which is ionised by two uncatalogued O8 V and B0 V stars and includes the star cluster King 10 and the young stellar object 2MASX J22555978+5814424.Sh 2-147, Sh 2-148, and Sh 2-149 form one of the two cores of the 105 thousand solar mass molecular cloud [UUT2000] Cloud A.

The much brighter nebula Sh 2-131 is part of the same structure."
151,"Five molecular clouds are part of the Sh 2-151 complex and have a total of 29 thousand solar masses. About 700 solar masses has been ionised by an unseen star that is likely obscured by dust in one of the molecular clouds.A fuzzy but interesting image that shows the molecular cloud structure of Sh 2-151 can be seen in this MSX infrared image here. This image is very similar to the radio image shown in figure 2a of this 1998 paper."
152,"The adjacent HII regions Sh 2-152 and Sh 2-153 appear to be physically related, with a major source of the ionising radiation being located in the brighter Sh 2-152 in an unnamed O9V star.Avedisova combines Sh 2-152 and Sh 2-153 into the star formation region SFR 108.78-0.94, which also contains 7 masers including well studied ones such as V* V627 Cas and SH 2-152 SE. Sh 2-252 also contains the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 36.Sh 2-152 and Sh 2-153 form one of the two cores of the 105 thousand solar mass molecular cloud [UUT2000] Cloud A. (The other core is associated with Sh 2-147, Sh 2-148, and Sh 2-149.) This molecular cloud may be interacting with the supernova remnant SNR G109.1-01.0 (CTB 109)."
153,"The adjacent HII regions Sh 2-152 and Sh 2-153 appear to be physically related with Sh 2-153 being the larger and fainter nebula in the image and a major source of the ionising radiation being located in the brighter Sh 2-152 in an unnamed O9V star.Avedisova combines Sh 2-152 and Sh 2-153 into the star formation region SFR 108.78-0.94, which also contains 7 masers including well studied ones such as V* V627 Cas and SH 2-152 SE.Sh 2-152 and Sh 2-153 form one of the two cores of the 105 thousand solar mass molecular cloud [UUT2000] Cloud A.

154,"Sh 2-154 is ionised by the B0 III giant LS III +60 28, according to Avedisova. She places the nebula in the star formation region SFR 108.96+1.59 along with a molecular cloud. According to a 2000 paper, radiation from stars associated with Sh 2-154 may be accelerating a giant molecular cloud that appears to contain 700 solar masses of carbon monoxide and perhaps 10 thousand solar masses in total viral mass."
155,"The Cave nebula interacts with the Cepheus B molecular cloud and is ionised by stars that belong to the Cep OB3 association. Sharpless lists 9 potential ionising stars, including the B0 class HD 217086. SIMBAD says that this object is actually a O7 Vn class young stellar object with multiple components.Avedisova places Sh 2-155 in the massive star formation region SFR 110.15+2.61 and lists 157 components, including 24 masers, 48 infrared sources and the dark nebulae LDN 1211 and LDN 1216.You can read more about the history of star formation in this region in the Cep OB3 section of the description of the Brain and Bubble (120Â° - 110Â°) sector in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane.A good image of this nebula can be found here. You can also view an interesting false colour MSX 8 Î¼m infrared image of this region here."
156,"Also called IC 1470, this HII region is part of the star cluster NGC 7510 according to Avedisova. It appears to be ionised by a single O7 class star. The bright core is only one of five distinct and apparently independent emission sources within a giant molecular cloud.Avedisova places Sh 2-156 in star formation region 110.12+0.04 with 35 components, including 7 masers, the reflection nebulae [SS62] 71 and PP 104 and the HII regions BFS 15 and BFS 16.Russeil expands this star formation region and adds the HII regions BFS 14, BFS 17 and BFS 18 as well."
157,"The northern portion of Sh 2-157 (Sim 13, sometimes known as Sh 2-157a) is a ring nebula around the Wolf-Rayet star WR 157, in the Basel 3 star cluster that is in turn part of the Cas OB2 association. The southern portion of Sh 2-157 (Sim 14) may be ionised by stars not belonging to Basel 3.Sh 2-157b is an ultracompact HII region visible within the more diffuse Sh 2-157a nebula.Avedisova lists 4 additional ionising stars for Sh 2-157 (besides WR 157). These include the O7 I supergiant BD+59 2673.The MSX infrared results reveal a very complex structure in this direction as can be seen in this image.You can see a detailed false-colour visual light image here."
158,"This is NGC 7538, a major star formation region in the Cas OB2 association. It is surrounded by the much larger diffuse nebula Sh 2-161B.The main ionising star for this nebula is the O7 V star [WBN74] NGC 7538 IRS 6, but it includes several other O-stars as well.Avedisova places Sh 2-158 in star formation region 111.54+0.82 with 101 components including 15 masers and the young stellar object NGC 7538 IRS 9.Russeil combines Sh 2-158 and Sh 2-159 into one star formation region. You can see the two nebulae embedded in the 595 thousand solar mass dust cloud [UUT2000] Cloud G in this MSX infrared image."
159,"Sh 2-159 appears to be ionised by the O9.5 class emission star [MO2001] 82.Russeil combines Sh 2-158 and Sh 2-159 into one star formation region. You can see the two nebulae embedded in the 595 thousand solar mass dust cloud [UUT2000] Cloud G in this MSX infrared image.All of these objects are part of the dusty Cas OB2 association.A wide area image that includes Sh 2-159 can be seen here."
160,"The HII region Sh 2-160 is located near or within the Cep OB3 association, which is part of the relatively nearby Cepheus molecular clouds, as can be seen on this face-on map. Sharpless lists three possible ionising stars including the B0 III giant HD 218323, which Humphreys assigns to Cep OB3.You can read more about the Cep OB3 association towards the bottom of the page describing the Brain and Bubble (120Â° - 110Â°) sector, which is part of the Commentary on the Galactic Plane.You can see a good image by Mel Martin of this nebula here."
161,"Sh 2-161 is a large diffuse nebula surrounding the much smaller (and better studied) Sh 2-158, which is visible in the bottom right of this image.The BFS catalog argues that Sh 2-161 is actually two distinct nebulae in the same line of sight, which they designate Sh 2-161a and Sh 2-161b. (Sharpless himself made no such distinction.)Curiously, however, the distance estimates given in the scientific literature for the two nebulae are almost identical despite the quite different velocities quoted for the gas in this direction."
162,"This is the Bubble nebula, NGC 7635, a circular shell around the O6.5 IIIf star BD +60Â°2522. The nebula also contains the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 44. You can see the faint nebulosity around the Bubble in this Astronomy Picture of the Day.The Bubble nebula is also bright at radio frequencies."
163,"According to Avedisova, this nebula is ionised by the O 9.5 V class star LSI +60 8. It contains the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 45.Russeil combines Sh 2-163, Sh-164 and Sh 2-166 into a single star formation region.The nebula can be seen as a faint ring in this MSX infrared image."
164,"According to Avedisova, this nebula is ionised by the B1 Ib supergiant LS I +59 10 which agrees with the class given by SIMBAD. Russeil also identifies it as the ionising star but gives a B0.2 II giant class.Russeil combines Sh 2-163, Sh-164 and Sh 2-166 into a single star formation region."
165,"Ionised by the B0 V star BD +61 +2494 and contains the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 46.This nebula has a prominent ring structure in infrared as can be seen in this MSX image."
166,"This faint nebula, ionised by the O9.5 V star BD +60 2607, forms part of the Cas OB5 supershell. Avedisova places it in the star formation region SFR 114.63-0.79 along with a water maser, the radio source KR 82 and the young stellar object Mol 160.Russeil combines Sh 2-163, Sh-164 and Sh 2-166 into a single star formation region.A recent Spitzer study concluded that Mol 160 is 3000 times more luminous than the sun, is accreting matter from a 220 solar mass dust cocoon and has not yet undergone hydrogen fusion."
167,"There is very little information in the scientific literature on this faint nebula. Sh 2-167 was previously listed as a planetary nebula but is now believed to be an HII region. It appears in the direction of a large expanding shell around Cas OB5, but the available distance estimates suggest that it may lie much further away in the Outer/Norma arm.The nebula can be seen in infrared in this MSX image."
168,"Avedisova concludes that the HII region Sh 2-168 is ionised by the O9 V star LS I +60 50. SIMBAD gives a slightly cooler B0 V spectral class. This is in the direction of an expanding shell surrounding Cas OB5.Avedisova places Sh 2-168 in the star formation region SFR 115.80-1.60 along with the radio source KR 84. The nebula includes the loose infrared cluster [BDS2003] 47 and the Herbig-Haro object GM 2-44.You can find a more detailed colour image here and a black and white hydrogen-alpha image created from IPHAS data using the process described here.This nebula is quite bright in infrared as this MSX 8Î¼m image reveals."
169,"A faint nebulosity near the direction of the much brighter Sh 2-168. Avedisova finds that it is ionised by the B0 III giant BD +59 2786."
170,"Sh 2-170 lies in the direction of the Cas OB5 supershell. There is some confusion about the designation of the ionising star.A 1995 paper concludes that the sole exciting star of Sh 2-170 is DM +63 2093, an O8 V star of 31 solar masses. Avedisova agrees on the star but gives a slightly cooler O9 V class. Curiously, SIMBAD gives a G5 spectral class for this star. Reed gives the name for the star in this location as LS I +64 11, which SIMBAD lists as the O9.5 multiple star BD +63 2093p. A 2004 paper agrees on the BD +63 2093p designation and agrees with Avedisova on the O9 V class. This paper also says that BD +63 2093p is a member of the small open cluster Stock 18 and estimates 910 +/- 90 solar masses for the hydrogen gas in the nebula.A wider view of this object can be found here."
171,"This expanding shell of gas and dust was created by the original star cluster at the heart of the Cep OB4 association, which has now dispersed. It is now lit and ionized by the young star cluster Berkeley 59 (forming the bright nebula called Cederblad 214) and it is expanding into the fainter diffuse nebula NGC 7822. Berkeley 59 is surrounded by another dark region of disturbed gas and dust containing the radio source W1.Avedisova lists 4 O-stars that ionise this nebula. The hottest of these is the O7 V BD +66 1675. She places Sh 2-171 in star formation region SFR 118.41+4.68 with 46 components, including 3 masers, 14 infrared sources and the dark nebula LDN 1271.A 2008 study adds a fifth ionising O-star to Berkeley 59, hotter than than any of the ones Avedisova identified. Spectographic analysis reveals that BD +66 1673 has a class of O5 V((f))n. The same study concludes that Berkeley 59 is 2 million years old. A second 2008 study agrees on the age and comments that Berkeley 59 has nine ionising stars in total (classes O-B3).There are more details on this nebula in the Cep OB4 section of the description of the Brain and Bubble (120Â° - 110Â°) sector of the Commentary on the Galactic Plane. You can also see the location of Cep OB4 and Sh 2-171 within the relatively nearby Cepheus molecular clouds on this face-on map. You can see a spectacular image of this region here and view the large shell surrounding the nebula in visual light and in this IRAS infrared image."
172,"Sh 2-172 contains the loose infrared cluster [BDS2003] 48.Russeil combines Sh 2-172, Sh 2-173 and Sh 2-177 into one star formation region and comments that no stellar distance is known for Sh 2-172. All three nebulae lie in the direction of the expanding shell of gas and dust surrounding the Cas OB5 association."
173,"Russeil combines Sh 2-172, Sh 2-173 and Sh 2-177 into one star formation region. All three nebulae lie in the direction of the expanding shell of gas and dust surrounding the Cas OB5 association.Russeil identifies 7 possible ionising stars for Sh 2-173, the hottest of which is the O9 V star ALS 6151 (BD +60 39). Avedisova associates Sh 2-173 with the star cluster NGC 103, the radio source KR 98, and the dark nebula LDN 1282.Sh 2-173 appears to be on the edge of the HI shell GSH 117.8+1.5-35 associated with Cas OB5.You can view detailed IPHAS hydrogen-alpha images of this nebula here."
174,"The former central star of this old planetary nebula, the white dwarf GD 561, has drifted to the outside of the nebula.A good image of this nebula can be found here."
175,"Sh 2-175 appears in the direction of a supershell of molecular and atomic hydrogen clouds surrounding the Cas OB5 association, which is part of the Perseus arm. A widely varying range of distances to this nebula and its potential ionising star has been published in the scientific literature.Avedisova gives the ionising star of Sh 2-175 as LS I +64 26 (O9.5 V), which Humphreys lists as a field star outside of any OB association. Russeil concludes that LS I +64 26 is actually a B1.5 V star at 1090 +/- 210 parsecs and locates Sh 2-175 at this much closer distance.You can read more about this region (with full references) in this galactic plane commentary."
176,"This is a planetary nebula. The central star is a blue subdwarf.You can find a good image of this nebula here."
177,"Sharpless and Avedisova both conclude that Sh 2-177 is ionised by the O9 V star BD +61 105.Russeil combines Sh 2-172, Sh 2-173 and Sh 2-177 into one star formation region. All three nebulae lie in the direction of the expanding shell of gas and dust surrounding the Cas OB5 association. You can view a good image of this irregular diffuse nebula here."
178,"There is very little in the scientific literature about this huge faint nebula located in a direction that is well above the galactic plane.Sh 2-178 is associated with the giant molecular cloud known as the Polaris Flare. The region's overall nebulosity does not derive from hydrogen-alpha emission in the region itself but instead from dusty cirrus clouds that reflect the light of the Milky Way.The nebula is visible at both radio and infrared frequencies. It is perhaps best seen in context as the brightest portion of a huge atomic hydrogen (HI) loop (GIRL G134+34) seen in this image. The loop is also visible in infrared in this IRAS image. In both cases, Sh 2-178 is the large emission region at the right.The star in the image is the K2 III giant HD 5848, which has a Hipparcos distance of only 96 parsecs, so presumably it is a foreground star unrelated to the nebula."
179,"This is the planetary nebula PN BV 5-2 (sometimes designated PN BV-2)."
180,"Sh 2-180 is visible in the direction of the Perseus arm Cas OB7 association, but a distance estimate based on CO velocity places it much further away in the Norma/Outer arm.Avedisova also locates it at a large distance and concludes that it is ionised by the O7.5V star LS I +62 139.The filaments visible in this image, more characteristic of a close supernova remnant than a distant HII region, suggests that this region may deserve deeper investigation."
181,"Radio observations and modelling suggest that Sh 2-181 is an HII region ionised by a B0 to B0.5 class star. A 1978 paper identifies the ionising star as the B1 V class LS I +64 47. The nebula is connected to the Cas OB7 association in the Perseus arm."
182,"Avedisova suggests that Sh 2-182 is ionised by the B3 Ia supergiant HD 4694.More recent studies, however, conclude that Sh 2-182 appears to be a reflection nebula (not an HII region) and may be associated with the infrared source and protoplanetary nebula IRAS 00470+6429."
183,"This is an apparently large and distant HII region that is obscured by foreground dust. It consists of 44 thousand solar masses of ionised gas and is at least 3.9 million years old. The stars ionising the gas are unknown and are probably obscured by the foreground dust.Avedisova locates Sh 2-183 in star formation region SFR 123.20+2.83, with 16 components, including a water maser and 8 infrared sources. One of these infrared sources is the young stellar object IRAS 00468+6527.This object shows an extended irregular structure at radio frequencies as this 2.7 GHz image taken with the Effelsberg 100m radio telescope reveals.I've used IPHAS hydrogen-alpha data to create a black and white image of this highly obscured nebula here.Sh 2-183 is visible as a diffuse nebula bordered by more compact emission sources in this IRAS infrared image.If this object is really located at 7000 parsecs, then the size in the radio image suggests that it may be one of the largest star formation regions in the outer galaxy. Note, however, that streaming motions in the Perseus arm can result in exaggerated distance estimates if velocity data is used alone to determine an object's distance (and the current distance estimate is, indeed, based on gas velocity)."
184,"Often called NGC 281, this bright nebula located far below the galactic plane is also nicknamed the Pac Man nebula by amateur astronomers after a 1980s-era video game character. IC 1590, the star cluster at the heart of the nebula, is about 3.5 million years old. The core of the star cluster IC 1590 is the trapezium system HD 5005, which ionises NGC 281 and contains an O5.5 class star.The distance to NGC 281 has been accurately measured via radio parallax as 2820 +/- 240 pc.It is highly unusual to find such a prominent nebula so far below the galactic plane and there is some evidence that it is on the edge of a superbubble that has blown out of the galactic plane, perhaps because of multiple supernova explosions.This nebula is often the subject of astrophotographers and there are many beautiful images of it on the Internet. One interesting false-colour version was Astronomy Picture of the Day.You can see a view of this nebula in infrared taken by the WISE satellite here."
185,"Sh 2-185 consists of a pair of nebulae, IC 59 and IC 63, that according to Sharpless and other authorities is ionised and illuminated by the B0 IVpe subgiant Gamma Cassiopeiae. It is a combination of a reflection nebula and HII region.Sh 2-185 lies in front of the Perseus arm Cas OB1 association as can be seen in this image but is much closer.A much better image of Sh 2-185 can be found here."
186,"Avedisova says that Sh 2-186 is ionised by the B0 III giant Hiltner 102 and is part of the Cas OB7 association. It contains the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 51."
187,"This young (100-200 thousand years) star formation region is most likely ionised by a B0 class star and is surrounded by a 4600 solar mass molecular cloud. It is partially obscured by the Lynds dark nebula LDN 1317 and contains the infrared star cluster [BDS2003] 52.Russeil lists three potential ionising stars, one with a B2.5V class.You can view a good visual image here of this rarely photographed object and a fuzzy hydrogen-alpha image created from IPHAS data here.This nebula is prominent in infrared as can be seen in this MSX image."
188,"This is a planetary nebula with an expansion age of 7500 years.You can view a more detailed image of this nebula here.Phil Plait calls this the ""Firefox Nebula""."
189,"This faint and distant purple ball is a planetary nebula also called Abell 3."
190,"The Heart nebula is ionised by the IC 1805 star cluster, which is part of the Cas OB6 association, and is the location of the W3 / W4 radio sources. Avedisova places this nebula in star formation region SFR 133.69+0.99 with 86 components including 11 masers. IC 1805 contains at least 10 O-class stars including 3 extremely rare ultra-hot O4 and O5 class stars.The correct distance to the W3 (OH) star formation region within Sh 2-190 has been measured with incredible accuracy using radio parallax as 2070 +10 / -20 pc.For more information see the Heart and Soul (140Â° - 130Â°) sector description in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane.You can view a stunning image of the larger Heart and Soul region here."

It seems possible that Sh 2-195 is not an HII region but is merely faint nebulosity seen in the general direction of GP Cas."
196,"According to one source, this HII region, which is most likely ionised by a B2.5 V class star, lies at the edge of a 1000 solar mass molecular cloud in a similar direction to the Sh 2-192 to Sh 2-194 group of nebulae. According to a 2007 paper by Russeil, Sh 2-196 may lie at the same distance as Sh 2-192 and Sh 2-193 (2400 +/- 320 parsecs), however she has identified a possible O9.5 class ionising star with a photometric distance of 5670 +/- 590 parsecs, suggesting that it may be much further away than the other nebulae.Avedisova places Sh 2-196 in star formation region SFR 136.45+2.53 with 21 components, including the radio source KR 147B, 4 masers and 9 infrared sources. Among the infrared sources are three distinct young stellar objects."
197,"This is the galaxy Maffei 2."
198,"Avedisova concludes that Sh 2-198 is ionised by the O9.5 V star LS I +59 153. This star is part of the cluster IC 1848 which also ionises the much larger Sh 2-199 (W5) HII region.Avedisova places Sh 2-198 in the star formation SFR 137.39+0.19 along with a hydroxyl maser and two young stellar objects."
199,"Often called the Soul nebula by amateur astronomers, the infant-shaped Sh 2-199 is ionised by stars belonging to the IC 1848 cluster and is also the location of the radio source W5. Like the Heart nebula (Sh 2-190) and surrounding smaller nebulae, Sh 2-199 is embedded in the Cas OB6 association.Kharchenko gives a distance of 2002 parsecs and an age of 4.4 million years for IC 1848 and lists 5 ionising stars: HD 17505 (O7, although SIMBAD gives an O6Ve class), HD 17520 (O9V), HD 237019 (O8V), HD 237007 (B0V), and HD 237011 (B2, although SIMBAD gives a slighter hotter B1.5 class). Avedisova places Sh 2-199 and Sh 2-201 in star formation region SFR 137.57+1.08, with 65 components, including 16 infrared sources, 2 masers and 4 young stellar objects.For more information see the Heart and Soul (140Â° - 130Â°) sector description in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane.You can view a stunning image of the larger Heart and Soul region here.

These are BD +56 864 (O6 V), HD 24372 (O9.5 Ib), Hiltner 52 (O7.5 V) and BD +56 866 (O9 V).The reference to HD 24372 appears to be an error because SIMBAD lists this as a F5V star in a completely different direction. Presumably Avedisova meant HD 237211 as this is a O9.5Iab star in the direction of Cam OB3. SIMBAD gives a cooler B0.5IV class for Hiltner 52.The distance estimates from Avedisova and Russeil both place this nebula beyond the Perseus arm and possibly associate it with the Norma/Outer arm. However, a 2005 study connects Sh 2-204 to the much closer Cam OB1 association.You can see a much better visual frequency image here."
205,"Both Sharpless and Avedisova list the O9 class multiple star HD 24431 as the main ionising star for the large diffuse Sh 2-205, sometimes called the Peanut nebula. Avedisova also lists two cooler B-class ionising stars. A recent series of papers divides the nebula into three distinct regions (although at similar distances), with the B-stars ionising a different region than HD 24431. They also suggest that CY Cam (HD 24094) may be an O8.5 or O9 star instead of the usually suggested much cooler B8 and may be the main ionising star of LBN 148.11-0.45 (LBN 696) in this direction.A 2011 paper states that CY Cam is a B1 III giant.Like Sh 2-202, this nebula lies at the edge of the Cam OB1 association.This false-colour hydrogen-alpha image reveals that Sh 2-205 is the brightest region of an even larger nebula.You can see an infrared image here and a false colour visual frequency image here."
206,"NGC 1491 is an older, evolved HII region ionised by the O5 star BD +50 886. SIMBAD gives a slightly cooler O6 class for this star.Contains the infrared star cluster [BDS2003] 62.A very good visual frequency image of this nebula is available here and a recent WISE infrared image here (Sh 2-206 (NGC 1491) is on the right)."
207,"Despite its appearance, this is an HII region ionised by an O9.5 IV star (MFJ SH 2-207 1) and not a planetary nebula.Avedisova places Sh 2-207 and Sh 2-208 together in the star formation region SFR 151.32+1.99 along with the radio source KR 198."
208,"According to the Reed catalog, there are at least three ionising stars in the direction of Sh 2-208: MFJ SH 2-208 3 (O9.5V), LS V +52 19 (O9.5 V) and MFJ SH 2-208 6 (B0V)The nebula also contains the optical cluster Waterloo 1 and the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 64.Avedisova places Sh 2-207 and Sh 2-208 together in the star formation region SFR 151.32+1.99 along with the radio source KR 198."
209,"This large and dusty star formation region in the outer galaxy contains the infrared star cluster [BDS2003] 65.Avedisova places Sh 2-209 in star formation region 151.60-0.24 with 14 components including a water maser, the young stellar object IRAS 04064+5052 (CPM 12) and numerous infrared and radio sources.Chini and Wink find three ionising stars: [CW84] S209-1 (B1III), [CW84] S209-2 (O9 III), and [CW84] S209-3 (B1).This MSX infrared image shows that Sh 2-209 appears to be the brightest spot on the edge of a bubble, which is confirmed by this recent WISE infrared image (Sh 2-209 is at the left)."
210,"There is, remarkably, essentially nothing in the scientific literature about this nebula even though it is prominent in hydrogen-alpha and visible at radio and infrared frequencies as well.Avedisova places Sh 2-210 in star formation region 152.81+2.90 with four infrared sources and the radio source RRF 1605. None of these objects have any scientific references either.Sh 2-210 lies in the direction of a larger diffuse nebulosity containing several B-class stars. Sh 2-207, Sh 2-208 and Lynds dark nebula LDN 1407 (Barnard 12) also appear in the direction of this diffuse nebulosity, although apparently are located at different distances."
211,"Sh 2-211 is located high above the galactic plane in the outer galaxy. It contains infrared cluster [BDS2003] 66 and may be embedded in the same CO cloud as Sh 2-212.I've created a good image of Sh 2-211 using IPHAS data."
212,"Sh 2-212 is located high above the galactic plane in the outer galaxy. It contains the star cluster NGC 1624 and may be embedded in the same CO cloud as Sh 2-211. It is associated with a 14 solar mass young stellar object visible near the ionisation ridge at the northwest edge of the nebula.Avedisova concludes that Sh 2-212 is ionised by two uncatalogued stars, of classes O6.5 V and B0 V. These appear to be recorded in SIMBAD as MFJ SH 2-212 2 (O5.5) and MFJ SH 2-212 4 (B0)."
213,"Sh 2-213 may be a very faint Stromgren sphere around a B4 class star in the cluster Berkeley 11. If so, it likely lies at a distance of 2100 parsecs."
214,"Beyond a short string of red pixels (which could be an artifact of the photographic plate) there is no visible nebulosity in this image. Avedisova places this object in star formation region SFR 157.59-3.91 along with the young T Tauri star IRAS 04172+4411. Beyond this association, there is essentially nothing in the scientific literature on this region."
215,"Avedisova places this local hairpin shaped molecular cloud in star formation region SFR 158.32-5.67 with the cool M5-class star HD 276164."
216,"This is the closest known planetary nebula and one of the oldest. According to SIMBAD, the central star is the white dwarf ALS 8032.A good image of this nebula is here."
217,"The 4 million year old HII region Sh 2-217 is ionised by the O9.5 V star LS V +47 24.Russeil places Sh 2-217 in the same star formation complex as Sh 2-219 and BFS 44."
218,"Very faint and diffuse nebula. Avedisova places Sh 2-218 in star formation region SFR 159.54+11.29 along with the dark nebula LDN 1460. BFS does not give a distance estimate for this object but in their notes describe it as a ""bright dark cloud"".The direction high above the galactic plane and the association with a dark nebula suggests a local dust cloud, but there are no significant references in the scientific literature to confirm this.The nebula is visible in infrared as can be seen in this WISE image."
219,"Avedisova concludes that Sh 2-219 is ionised by the stars LS V +47 24 (O9.5 V) and LS V +47 22 (B0 V).The nebula is very young - perhaps only about 100 thousand years old. There is also an embedded star cluster to the southwest and a nearby 2000 solar mass molecular cloudRusseil places Sh 2-219 in the same star formation complex as Sh 2-217 and BFS 44."
220,"This is the California nebula (NGC 1499), which is ionised by the O7.5 III giant Menkhib (Xi Persei) in the Per OB2 association within the California molecular cloud. Avedisova places the California nebula in star formation region SFR 160.00-12.31 with 17 components. Among these are the dark nebula LDN 1449, five infrared sources and several reflection nebulae, including GM 1-14 and VDB 24. VDB 24 includes the young Orion-type variable star XY Per.Avedisova also places Sh 2-220 in SFR 173.50-15.0 (the Taurus dark clouds). It is highly unusual for Avedisova to place the same nebula into two star formation regions (perhaps one of these is an error?).This region is indeed part of the local Taurus dust cloud complex (which also extends in the direction of the constellation Perseus). You can see an interesting large scale image of this region in infrared (part of the Milky Way Explorer). This is part of the Gould Belt, our local region of the Milky Way.You can view an astonishing narrow-band false colour image of the California nebula here."
221,"This prominent supernova remnant, better known as HB9 (SNR G160.4+02.8), is visible both at hydrogen alpha and radio frequencies.It is incorrectly listed by SIMBAD as an HII region."
222,"Also called NGC 1579 and informally the ""Trifid of the North"", this dusty reflection nebula contains a cluster of about 5 bright B class stars and 35 other stars. The cluster is dominated by the massive young star LkHÎ± 101.You can see a good image of this nebula here."
223,"This is the radio source OHIO A 184 (normally referred to in the scientific literature as OA 184).BFS describe Sh 2-223 as a supernova remnant and reference a 1972 paper, which identifies the object at this location as OA 184. SIMBAD contains separate entries for OA 184 and Sh 2-223 but this appears to be incorrect.A 2006 paper concludes that OA 184 is not a supernova remnant but an HII region ionised by the O7.5 V star BD +41 1144 at a distance of 2200 +/- 400 parsecs."
224,"This is the supernova remnant SNR 166.0 +4.3, which is visible at both hydrogen-alpha and radio frequencies. SIMBAD maintains separate entries for SNR 166.0 +4.3 and Sh 2-224, but this seems incorrect according to the scientific literature.One study estimates the age as 81 thousand years.A much better image of this object can be found here."
225,"The HII region Sh 2-225 contains the young stellar object candidate IRAS 05235+4033 and is ionised by the O9 V star LS V +40 46."
226,"Little appears in the scientific literature about this nebula. It is more prominent at radio and infrared frequencies than hydrogen-alpha, suggesting that it is visually obscured. Avedisova places it in star formation region SFR 168.48-0.97 with two masers. It is near in the sky to the better studied Sh 2-228 and has a roughly similar distance estimate. Both nebulae appear to lie behind the Aur OB1 association in the outer galaxy."
227,"Avedisova concludes that this little-studied nebula is ionised by the O9 V star LS V +38 12. It appears behind the western edge of the Aur OB1 association in the outer galaxy.A much better image appears here."
228,"Sh 2-228 contains the infrared star cluster [IBP2002] CC01. The 1800 solar mass cluster is 1 to 2 million years old, and the surrounding field stars about 5-6 million years old."
229,"The Flaming Star nebula (IC 405) is a reflection nebula and HII region ionised by the runaway O9.5Ve class multiple star AE Aurigae.Research suggests that AE Aurigae was ejected from the Orion star formation region about 2.5 million years ago.The Skyfactory site has a spectacular image of this region here."
230,"This enormous diffuse nebula appears in the direction of the Aur OB1 and Aur OB2 associations in the outer galaxy. Only a small detail of this nebula is shown in the accompanying image.Avedisova lists 3 B-class ionising stars, including the B0.5IV double subgiant HD 35633. She places it in the star formation region 172.97-1.31 along with the infrared source and HII region [DZC2005] Z and the star cluster NGC 1907.You can view images of this nebula here."
231,"According to Avedisova, this visually faint nebula is ionised by the O9.5V class star LS V +35 24. Avedisova combines Sh 2-231 and Sh 2-233 into a single star formation region, 173.37+2.55, that contains 7 masers and numerous young stellar objects.Sh 2-231 to Sh 2-235 form a complex of HII regions located together in the Perseus arm in the outer galaxy. This complex may be associated with an old (330 thousand years) supernova remnant, FVW 172.8+1.5.There is a giant molecular cloud, G174+2.5, containing Sh 2-231, Sh 2-232, Sh 2-233, and Sh 2-235 that is at a distance of about 1800 pc."
232,"This peculiar belted nebula is ionised by two giant stars: the O9.5 III HD 37737 and an anonymous B0 II class star according to Avedisova.HD 37737 may be a runaway star and is a close binary with a period of 7.84 days.Sh 2-231 to Sh 2-235 form a complex of HII regions located together in the Perseus arm in the outer galaxy. This complex may be associated with an old (330 thousand years) supernova remnant, FVW 172.8+1.5.There is a giant molecular cloud, G174+2.5, containing Sh 2-231, Sh 2-232, Sh 2-233, and Sh 2-235 that is at a distance of about 1800 pc."
233,"The visually obscured Sh 2-233 contains the high-mass proto star cluster IRAS 05358+3543 (Sh 2-233 IR).Avedisova combines Sh 2-231 and Sh 2-233 into a single star formation region, 173.37+2.55, that contains 7 masers and numerous young stellar objects.Sh 2-231 to Sh 2-235 form a complex of HII regions located together in the Perseus arm in the outer galaxy. This complex may be associated with an old (330 thousand years) supernova remnant, FVW 172.8+1.5.(Sh 2-235 is the bright nebula dominating the left side of this image.)There is a giant molecular cloud, G174+2.5, containing Sh 2-231, Sh 2-232, Sh 2-233, and Sh 2-235 that is at a distance of about 1800 pc."
234,"This is IC 417, sometimes called the Spider nebula. Sharpless 2-234 and 2-237 are together sometimes called the Spider and the Fly.IC 417 surrounds the star cluster Stock 8. Avedisova gives two ionising stars: HD 35619 (O7V) and BD +34 1054 (B0 IV). SIMBAD gives O9.5V for this second star.Sh 2-231 to Sh 2-235 form a complex of HII regions located together in the Perseus arm in the outer galaxy. This complex may be associated with an old (330 thousand years) supernova remnant, FVW 172.8+1.5."
235,"This kidney-shaped HII region is the intersection point of two massive giant molecular clouds (100 thousand and 300 thousand solar masses respectively) with intense star formation. Infrared analysis using the Spitzer space telescope has found 86 young stellar objects within Sh 2-235.One of these molecular clouds, G174+2.5, contains Sh 2-231, Sh 2-232, Sh 2-233, and Sh 2-235 and lies at a distance of about 1800 pc.Sh 2-235 is ionised by the O9.5 V star BD +35 1201. Avedisova places this nebula in star formation region SFR 173.61+2.80 with 54 components, including 7 masers, the smaller HI region BFS 46 and several Herbig-Haro objects.Sh 2-231 to Sh 2-235 form a complex of HII regions located together in the Perseus arm in the outer galaxy. This complex may be associated with an old (330 thousand years) supernova remnant, FVW 172.8+1.5.You can view a larger visual frequency image of Sh 2-235 here and an infrared image here."
236,"Lying at the core of the Aur OB2 association, the great HII region IC 410 (associated with the radio source W8) surrounds the star cluster NGC 1893 and is sometimes called the Tadpole nebula because of tadpole like structures (the nebulae Sim 129 and Sim 130) visible in detailed images. Avedisova lists 5 ionising stars (including 4 O-class stars). The hottest of these is the O5 V star HD 242908. She places Sh 2-136 in the star formation region SFR 173.63-1.70 along with the young stellar object IRAS 05198+3325.A 2002 study states that NGC 1893 contains ""at least five O-type stars"".There is an enormous range of distance estimates for NGC 1893. The most recent estimates appear to be converging around 3500 pc, consistent with a location in the Perseus arm."
237,"Sometimes called the Fly nebula, this nebula surrounds the open cluster NGC 1931. Sharpless 2-234 and 2-237 are together sometimes called the Spider and the Fly.Avedisova lists two B0 V class ionising stars: LS V +34 46 and LS V +34 47.A more detailed image of Sh 2-237 is here."
238,"Hind's nebula (NGC 1555, HH 155) is a Herbig-Haro nebula surrounding the young G5V class T Tauri triple variable star system within the Taurus dark cloud complex, which is inside the Gould belt, our local galactic neighbourhood."
239,"Sh 2-239 is not a HII region but a reflection nebula and a collection of Herbig-Haro objects embedded in the dark cloud LDN 1551. The brightest part of Sh 2-239 is catalogued as the Herbig-Haro object HH 102. It is located near the star T Tauri within the Taurus dark cloud complex, which is inside the Gould belt, our local galactic neighbourhood."
240,"This is the supernova remnant Sim 147 (SNR 180.0-01.7). Visit this site or this site for better and more comprehensive images of Sim 147."
241,"This nebula is ionised by the O9V star LS V +30 31. The nebula is a blister on the side of a molecular cloud. This field also contains the reflection nebula vdB 65, which is a completely unrelated object at 1100 parsecs.Avedisova places this nebula in star formation region 180.90+4.13 with two water masers and the emission star MWC 790.You can view a more detailed image here."
242,"According to Avedisova, this HII region is ionised by the B0 V class star BD +26 980. The distance estimates place it in the Perseus arm."
243,"There is no visible nebulosity on this image, no known ionising stars in this direction, nor has anything been detected at radio frequencies. It is not clear whether this object actually exists."
244,"This is the Crab nebula supernova remnant (M1), the remains of a star known to have exploded in the year 1054."
245,"Sometimes called the Fishhook nebula, Sh 2-245 is one of the largest nebulae in apparent extent in the Sharpless catalog. It appears as a bright hydrogen-alpha ridge towards the southern end of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. The Orion-Eridanus superbubble is ionised by the total ultraviolet radiation from the Ori OB1 association.You can see a false colour image of the Fishhook nebula here."
246,"Sh 2-246 is visible in the direction of Lynds dark cloud LDN 1562, which together with Lynds dark cloud LDN 1563 forms a local dust ridge located well below the galactic plane at a distance of 180 pc, and is part of the Taurus dark cloud complex, which is inside the Gould belt, our local galactic neighbourhood.BFS provide no distance estimate for this nebula but note ""Bright dark cloud"".Avedisova concludes that Sh 2-246 and LDN 1562 are part of the same star formation region, SFR 186.96-16.58. If Sh 2-246 is actually embedded in this dust ridge, it must be much closer than the distance estimate given here."
247,"According to a 1989 study, Sh 2-247 is part of the Gem OB1 association, contains 37 thousand solar masses of gas and dust at a distance of 2200 pc, and appears to be physically connected through CO filaments with Sh 2-252. It is ionised by the B0 III giant LS V +21 27. Avedisova places Sh 2-247 in the complex star formation region SFR 188.93+0.79 with 51 components, including 9 masers, several infrared star clusters, at least 4 molecular clouds, and the young stellar object IRAS 06058+2138. In 1984 she gave a 3500 pc distance estimate but corrected this to 2000 pc in 1989.The available distance estimates suggests a location on the near side of the Perseus arm."
248,"This is the Jellyfish nebula, a 3000-year-old supernova remnant (SNR 189.1+03.0, Gem A, IC 443).You can see a beautiful image of IC 443 and the HII region Sh 2-249 here."
249,"This HII region is ionised by members of the Gem OB1 association. Avedisova lists 3 B-class ionising stars (HD 43753, HD 43818 and HD 255091). Humphreys places all three of these stars in Gem OB1.Avedisova places Sh 2-249 in star formation region SFR 189.01+4.02 along with the smaller HII region BFS 51, three reflection nebulae, and the dark nebulae LDN 1564, LDN 1567, and LDN 1568.The relationship between Sh 2-249 and the adjacent supernova remnant Sh 2-248 (IC 443) is unclear. A 1984 paper concluded that Sh 2-249 is not a foreground source for IC 443 implying that it may be further away than the supernova remnant.You can see a beautiful image of the supernova remnant Sh 2-248 (IC 443) and Sh 2-249 here."
250,"Sh 2-250 is the brightest portion of an extremely faint ring surrounding the B2.5Vne class emission star HD 29441. It is located in the direction of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble surrounding the Ori OB1 association.You can see the ring and the nebula position here and the star position here.You can see an interesting image of the faint nebulosity in this direction here."
251,"Sh 2-250 and Sh 2-251 appear to be areas of nebulosity within the Orion-Eridanus superbubble, like Sh 2-245. The superbubble is ionised by ultraviolet radiation from the hot stars of the Ori OB1 association."
252,"The Monkey nebula (NGC 2174, also called the Monkey's Head nebula) contains five star clusters, including two which form the stellar group NGC 2175. It lies in the Perseus arm within the Gemini giant molecular clouds. By far the most important source of ionising radiation is the O6.5 V class star HD 42088.Sh 2-252 may be connected to Sh 2-247 by CO clouds.For more information on this complex region, see the Gem OB1 section of the description of the Jellyfish (190Â° - 180Â°) sector in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane."

254,"The Sh 2-254 to Sh 2-258 HII regions are embedded in a molecular cloud with 27 thousand solar masses of gas and dust. The dense central core of the cloud, which includes the young massive cluster S255-2, is located between the two bright nebulae Sh 2-255 and Sh 2-257. This star formation complex, catalogued by Avedisova as 192.60-0.05, contains 6 ionising stars, a massive proto stellar cluster (Sh 2-255N), three infrared clusters and 11 masers.Sh 2-254 is the large faint nebula at the right of this image.This labelled image identifies the position of each nebula.For more information on this star formation region and detailed references, see the Gem OB1 section of the description of the Orion (200Â° - 190Â°) sector of the Commentary on the Galactic Plane."

259,"This HII region lies in the direction of the Gem OB1 molecular clouds but its distance seems to make it a background object in the outer Cygnus arm. It is centred around the B1 V star ALS 18669."
260,"This filamentary nebulosity is seen in the direction of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. It is most likely associated with the Lambda Orionis ring (Sh 2-264) according to one source.This Milky Way Explorer image shows that the nebula is in a similar direction as the B2 III giant HD 30836.You can see a more detailed image of this little-studied nebula here."
261,"Lower's nebula is an HII region ionised by the O7.5V runaway star HD 41997."
262,"Another little-studied nebula in the direction of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. BFS detect no CO emission in this direction. A 2005 paper comments that Sh 2-262 is most likely associated with the Lambda Orionis ring (Sh 2-264), and indeed, it can be seen in this Milky Way Explorer image as an hydrogen-alpha ridge visible below Sh 2-264.Dean Salman has created a detailed image of this nebula."
263,"This HII region and reflection nebula is ionised by the B0-B1 V star HD 34989. Avedisova places it in star formation region SFR 195.06-11.99 as part of the Lambda Orionis ring complex along with Sh 2-264, Sh 2-265 and the dark nebula LDN 1582 (Barnard 32).Dean Salman has created a detailed image of this nebula."
264,"The combined HII region and supernova remnant Sh 2-264 is called the Angelfish nebula because of its appearance in visual light, or the Lambda Orionis ring because of its appearance in infrared. It is ionised by the O8 III subgiant star Lambda Orionis, and to a lesser extent, the 11 B stars near to it, which together form the loose star association Collinder 69, often called the Lam Ori cluster.The region around Lambda Orionis is dominated by a ring of molecular clouds whose structure can perhaps best be explained by a supernova very close to the star about 1 million years ago. The image shows only a small fragment of Sh 2-264.This object is impressive at visual frequencies and astonishing in infrared, which shows the true extent of the ring of molecular clouds surrounding the HII region."
265,"This diffuse HII region is part of the Barnard 223 dark cloud in the southern part of the Lambda Orionis ring (most of which forms the huge Sh 2-264 HII region). However, Sh 2-265 is not ionised by Lambda Orionis itself. Instead it is probably ionised by stars in the Ori OB1b portion of the Ori OB1 association.Avedisova places it in star formation region SFR 195.06-11.99 as part of the Lambda Orionis ring complex along with Sh 2-263, Sh 2-264 and the dark nebula LDN 1582 (Barnard 32).The position of this nebula in the BFS Vizier catalog is currently incorrect."
266,"Sh 2-266 is a peculiar object consisting of a cometary nebula surrounding the Be class supergiant MWC 137, which may be generating a strong stellar wind and appears to be surrounded by a small star cluster. It appears to be located in the Cygnus (outer) arm."
267,"This HII region (sometimes incorrectly identified as a planetary nebula) is ionised by the O9 V class star MFJ SH 2-267 2 and contains the infrared cluster [BDS 2003] 81."
268,"This large but faint nebula is prominent in hydrogen-alpha and infrared. According to Avedisova, it is ionised by the B1 III giant HD 42352.The position of this nebula in the BFS Vizier catalog and in SIMBAD is currently incorrect.For more information on this region, including detailed references, see the Sh 2-266 to Sh 2-272 section of the description of the Orion (200Â° - 190Â°) sector in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane."
269,"Sh 2-269 lies in front of a 8700 solar mass giant molecular cloud in the Cygnus (outer) arm. It is bisected by a dust lane and is ionised by two stars in the western side of the nebula. One is a B0.5 V star (MFJ Sh 2-269 2), the other is visible only in the infrared and appears to be either O8 or O9.5."
270,"This bipolar nebula contains an infrared star cluster (IRAS 06073+1249) embedded in a 1000 solar mass molecular cloud and may be ionised by a B0.5 V class star. There are a wide range of distance estimates available for this object. Some estimates place it in the Perseus arm, and others closer to the Outer arm.For more information on this region, including detailed references, see the Sh 2-266 to Sh 2-272 section of the description of the Orion (200Â° - 190Â°) sector of the Commentary on the Galactic Plane."
271,"Sh 2-271 contains the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 82 and is embedded in a 9800 solar mass molecular cloud. This is an HII region, not a planetary nebula as is sometimes reported.Sh 2-271 and the much fainter Sh 2-272 are both part of the Avedisova star formation region 197.77-2.31. She concludes that these nebulae are ionised by two uncatalogued stars: MFJ Sh 2-271 1 (O9 V) and MFJ Sh 2-272 3 (B1 V)."
272,"Sh 2-272 is an HII region, not a planetary nebula as is sometimes reported.Sh 2-271 and the much fainter Sh 2-272 are both part of the Avedisova star formation region 197.77-2.31. She concludes that these nebulae are ionised by two uncatalogued stars: MFJ Sh 2-271 1 (O9 V) and MFJ Sh 2-272 3 (B1 V)."
273,"The Fox Fur nebula is associated with the Christmas Tree star cluster NGC 2264, dominated by the O7Ve multiple star system S Monocerotis (S Mon). This region, which is part of the larger Mon OB1 association, also includes the famous Cone nebula, visible at the bottom of the image.You can find out more about this region in the Mon OB1 section of the description of the Fox Fur and Rosette (210Â° - 200Â°) sector in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane.A better image of the Fox Fur nebula region can be found here. A wide scale view that shows the huge region of nebulosity in this direction is here.The relatively close distance estimate suggests that Mon OB1 is part of the Orion spur."
274,"The Medusa nebula, Abell 21, is a 8800 year old planetary nebula.These images from Dean Salman also show the larger surrounding nebulosity."
275,"This is the Rosette Nebula, one of the most beautiful sights in the Milky Way. The star cluster NGC 2244, part of the Mon OB2 association, contains about 2000 stars and forms a blister at one end of the 130 thousand solar mass Rosette molecular cloud. About 30 of these stars are hot enough to ionise the nebula.Avedisova places the Rosette nebula in star formation region SFR 206.30-2.11 with 114 components, including 6 masers, 34 infrared sources and the radio source W16.Near by the Rosette molecular cloud are two smaller clouds associated with the HII regions Sh 2-280 and Sh 2-282.You can find out more about this region in the Mon OB2 section of the description of the Fox Fur and Rosette (210Â° - 200Â°) sector in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane.An astonishing image that shows the entire Monoceros region in one image (including the Fox Fur nebula) can be found here."
276,"Barnard's Loop is a ring of ionised gas that appears to surround the Flame (Sh 2-277) and Orion (Sh 2-281) nebulae and is the brightest portion of the much larger Orion-Eridanus superbubble. Many researchers assume that Barnard's Loop is physically associated with these nebulae and the Orion molecular clouds. However, a 2005 study argues that Barnard's Loop is considerably closer than the gas that makes up the main portion of the Orion molecular clouds.This image shows only a small portion of the nebula. You can see the full Loop here."
277,"This is the Flame nebula, also known as the radio source W 12 and contained within the molecular cloud Orion B. It is associated with the star cluster NGC 2024 and is largely ionised by the obscured O8-O9.7 star 2MASS J05414580-0154297. It can be seen in a similar direction as the O9.5Ib multiple supergiant Alnitak (Zeta Orionis), one of the three prominent hot young stars in Orion's belt.You can see a spectacular view of the Flame nebula and the nearby Horsehead nebula in this image."
278,"This is the high latitude cloud MBM 110. Avedisova places it in star formation region SFR 206.70-20.5 along with the dark nebula LDN 1634 and the reflection nebula NGC 1788.You can view a beautiful image of this nebula here."
279,"Located near in the sky to the Orion nebula, Sh 2-279 is often called the Running Man nebula and is a combination of a reflection nebula and an HII region. Sharpless says that this nebula is ionised by the B3 star HD 37018 (42 Orionis). (SIMBAD gives a hotter B1 V class.) Kharchenko places this star in the star cluster NGC 1977. A 1977 paper agrees that HD 37018 ionises Sh 2-279, and adds that Sh 2-279 is an HII region that includes the star clusters NGC 1973, NGC 1975 and NGC 1977. (SIMBAD identifies these objects as ""bright nebula"" rather than star clusters.)Avedisova places Sh 2-279 in star formation region SFR 210.76-19.61 with a number of better known objects, including the nebula IC 430, the HII regions M 43 and NGC 1999, the star clusters NGC 1977 and NGC 1980 and the dark nebula LDN 1647.You can view a beautiful image of this nebula here."
280,"The HII region Sh 2-280 appears to be located near or at the edge of the Rosette molecular cloud. Avedisova suggests two possible ionising stars, the O7 HD 46573 and the B0 III giant HD 46847. A 1981 paper also states that the ionising star for this HII region is HD 46573. HD 46573 may be an outlying star of the NGC 2244 cluster, which ionises Sh 275, the Rosette nebula.You can view good images of Sh 2-280 on Dean Salman's site here."
281,"This is the Orion nebula, best known as Messier 42. It is located within the Orion A molecular cloud and is ionised by the Trapezium (Theta-1 Orionis) multiple star system, dominated by the O6 V class multiple Theta-1 Orionis C.There are thousands of good images of the Orion nebula available on-line. Two of the most interesting are the Spitzer infrared view and this incredibly detailed Hubble view."
282,"The ionising star of this HII region, the pulsating variable O9.5III giant HD 47432 (the bright star in the upper part of the image), is probably a member of the Mon OB2 association. The HII region contains a system of eight cometary globules."
283,"Sh 2-283 includes the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 84 and according to Avedisova is ionised by an uncatalogued B0 V class star (MFJ Sh 2-283 8).Russeil concludes the Sh 2-283 to Sh 2-286 are all part of one star formation region located in the Milky Way's Cygnus (Outer) arm. These nebulae are described in detail in the description of the Monoceros Arc (220Â° - 210Â°) sector in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane."
284,"This large complex of HII regions is associated with the 6 million year old low metal star cluster Dolidze 25 and is one of the few relatively unobscured major star formation regions in the outer galaxy.Russeil concludes the Sh 2-283 to Sh 2-286 are all part of one star formation region located in the Milky Way's Norma (Outer) arm. These nebulae are described in detail in the description of the Monoceros Arc (220Â° - 210Â°) sector in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane.You can see an excellent hydrogen-alpha image of this nebula here and a combined infrared and hydrogen-alpha image here."
285,"Sh 2-285 contains at least two B0 V stars (LS VI -0 9 and MFJ Sh 2-285 1) and the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 85.Russeil concludes the Sh 2-283 to Sh 2-286 are all part of one star formation region located in the Milky Way's Cygnus (Outer) arm. These nebulae are described in detail in the description of the Monoceros Arc (220Â° - 210Â°) sector in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane."
286,"Sh 2-286 contains the infrared cluster [BDS2003] 88 and appears in the direction of the molecular cloud [MAB97] 217.38-1.38.Russeil concludes the Sh 2-283 to Sh 2-286 are all part of one star formation region located in the Milky Way's Cygnus (Outer) arm. These nebulae are described in detail in the description of the Monoceros Arc (220Â° - 210Â°) sector in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane."
287,"Sh 2-287 appears to be associated with the massive cold Maddalena's cloud in the Perseus arm. It contains 4000-5000 solar masses of gas and dust and a bipolar nebula, NS 14 (BFS 57). Avedisova concludes that Sh 2-287 is ionised by the O9.5 V star LS VI -04 19 and places it in star formation region 218.12-0.38 with 19 components, including the eight sources of the infrared complex FT 91 ([FT96] 218.1-0.4), several other infrared sources, and the Herbig-Haro object HH 227.You can read more about Sh 2-287 and the larger region it is part of in the Sh 2-287 and the Maddalena cloud section of the description of the Monoceros Arc (220Â° - 210Â°) sector in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane."
288,"This HII region, also called IC 466, is ionised by an O9V star.You can see a slightly more detailed image here."
289,"Avedisova concludes that Sh 2-289 is ionised by the B0.5 V class LSS 86 and an uncatalogued B1 V class star (MFJ Sh 2-289 2). Curiously, she omits two other ionising stars mentioned by MFJ: LS 85 and MFJ Sh 2-289 4. (Both are B-class according to SIMBAD.)One huge distance estimate of more than ten thousand parsecs may place this nebula beyond even the Cygnus (Outer) arm. However, closer estimates are also available.Sh 2-289 is located well below the galactic plane, and this may in part be related to an outer galaxy warp in the third quadrant which bends the galactic disk downwards.See the Other Outer Arm Objects section in the description of the Monoceros Arc (220Â° - 210Â°) sector in the Commentary on the Galactic Plane for more information and detailed references."
290,"This is the planetary nebula Abell 31.You can see a brighter image of this nebula here."
291,"Avedisova associates Sh 2-291 with the carbon star EM Mon and places them both in the star formation region 220.52-2.77.The available distance estimates place Sh 2-291 in the Cygnus (Outer) arm.No ionising star appears to have been identified in the scientific literature.Dean Salman has imaged Sh 2-291 together with the nearby BFS 63 in this image."
292,"The head of the Seagull nebula is both an HII region and reflection nebula (VDB 93). It is part of the CMa OB1 association and is ionised by the B0IV:e subgiant HD 53367, a young 20 solar mass star with a 5 solar mass companion in a highly elliptical orbit.Avedisova places this nebula in star formation region SFR 224.20-1.60 with other parts of the Seagull nebula.You can find good images of both the head and the wings of the Seagull nebula here and here and read a detailed commentary on the Seagull (230Â° - 220Â°) sector, which is part of the Commentary on the Galactic Plane"
293,"Sh 2-293 is a roughly spherical nebula that appears in front of the right wing of the much larger Seagull nebula.According to Avedisova, Sh 2-293 is ionised by the B2 III giant HD 52721. SIMBAD gives a slightly different B2Vne class for this star and identifies it as the illuminating source for the reflection nebula VDB 88, implying that Sh 2-293 may be both an HII region and reflection nebula.Avedisova places it in star formation region SFR 224.20-1.60 with other parts of the Seagull nebula. However, in a 1989 study she places Sh 2-293 at a distance of about 750 parsecs, which is considerably closer than the other parts of the Seagull nebula, implying that it may be a foreground object.You can read a detailed commentary on the Seagull (230Â° - 220Â°) sector, which is part of the Commentary on the Galactic Plane.You can see a labeled diagram of parts of the Seagull nebula region (including Sh 2-293) at the bottom left of this page.You can see Sh 2-293 and Sh 2-295 together in this image by astrophotographer Dean Salman."
294,"According to Avedisova this HII region is ionised by an uncatalogued B0.5 V star (MFJ Sh 2-294 4). It contains the loose infrared star cluster [BDS2003] 95 which is divided into two sub-clusters, the denser one surrounding the ionising star.Its odd shape looks like an upside down octopus - should it perhaps be called the Octopus nebula?"
295,"A small HII region located in front of the right wing of the Seagull nebula. Avedisova says that it is ionised by three B2 V class stars: HD 52942, HD 53010 and BD -11 1761. She places it in star formation region SFR 224.20-1.60 with other parts of the Seagull nebula. However, in a 1989 paper she gives a distance estimate of about 700 parsecs, closer than the main portion of the Seagull nebula and implying that it may be a foreground object.SIMBAD lists HD 52942 as the illuminating star for the reflection nebula VDB 90a and BD -11 1761 as the illuminating star for the reflection nebula VDB 92b, implying that the HII region surrounds several reflection nebulae.You can read a detailed commentary on the Seagull (230Â° - 220Â°) sector, which is part of the Commentary on the Galactic Plane.You can see a labeled diagram of parts of the Seagull nebula region (including Sh 2-293) at the bottom left of this page.You can see Sh 2-293 and Sh 2-295 together in this image by astrophotographer Dean Salman."
296,"This large nebula forms the wings of the Seagull Nebula and in hydrogen-alpha can be seen to be an ionised shell surrounding the CMa OB1 star association (also sometimes identified as the CMa R1 association).Avedisova lists 4 ionising stars for Sh 2-296, including 3 B-class stars and the O6.5V star HD 54662. (SIMBAD gives an O7III class for this star.) She places it in star formation region SFR 224.20-1.60 with other parts of the Seagull nebula.You can find good images of both the head and the wings of the Seagull nebula here and here and read a detailed commentary on the Seagull (230Â° - 220Â°) sector, which is part of the Commentary on the Galactic Plane."
297,"This HII region and reflection nebula is located at the tip of the right wing of the Seagull nebula. It is also known as the reflection nebula VDB 94. It is located next to the cold dark nebula LDN 1657A.Avedisova lists 5 possible ionising stars, including the O7.5 V star HD 53975, the O9.5 V star HD 54879 and the B1 II/III star HD 53623. (SIMBAD gives the class of HD 53975 as B7, too cool to be an ionising star. SIMBAD may be incorrect, however.) She places Sh 2-297 in star formation region SFR 224.20-1.60 with other parts of the Seagull nebula.You can find good images of both the head and the wings of the Seagull nebula here and here and read a detailed commentary on the Seagull (230Â° - 220Â°) sector, which is part of the Commentary on the Galactic Plane.You can see more of the surrounding nebulosity in this image by Dean Salman and more detail in the nebula itself in this image by Adam Block."
298,"Nicknamed Thor's Helmet, this nebula (also called NGC 2359) is a wind blown bubble ionised by the Wolf-Rayet star WR 7 (HD 56925).You can view much better images of Thor's Helmet here and here."
299,"Avedisova combines Sh 2-299 and Sh 2-300 into the star formation region SFR 230.98+1.49 and says that they are ionised by three B0-class stars: LSS 465 (MFJ SH 2-299 1), LSS 478 (MFJ SH 2-300 1) and the supergiant LSS 480 (MFJ SH 2-300 6).A 1995 paper places Sh 2-299, Sh 2-300, Sh 2-305, Sh 2-306, Sh 2-307 and Sh 2-309 into the same giant molecular cloud complex. A 1996 paper places Sh 2-305 to Sh 2-309 into molecular cloud [JKK96] D within the enormous infrared ring called the GS234-02 supershell, in the Perseus arm.You can view the enormous dust ring around the supershell in this WISE infrared image.

301,"According to Avedisova, Sh 2-301 is ionised by the O6 V star LSS 207 and the B1 V star LSS 212 and places it in star formation region SFR 231.44-4.41 along with several reflection nebulae including Bran 6 and Bran 7 A-D.This HII region may be associated with the GS234-02 supershell.You can see another image of this region here."
302,"This HII region lies within the molecular cloud [JKK96] A and is located well in front of the GS234-02 supershell. It contains the infrared star cluster [DBS2003] 4. Avedisova concludes that it is ionised by stars associated with the Bochum 5 cluster, including the O9.5 V star HD 59986, and places it in star formation region SFR 232.56+0.89, along with several other HII regions and reflection nebulae including VDB 97.The class for HD 59986 is supported by a 1995 paper by Russeil, the Georgelins and colleagues. SIMBAD, however, gives the class for HD 59986 as B5, which would make it too cool to be an ionising star.Here's another image of this object from an astrophotographer who imaginatively calls it the Snowman nebula."
303,"According to a 1982 study, this nebula is ionised by the Wolf-Rayet star WR 6 (EZ CMa) along with Sh 2-304 and Sh 2-308. However, a look at this region in hydrogen-alpha suggests that Sh 2-303 is the brightest part of a ring that appears to surround several B class giants, including LS 92 (B2/3 III) and HD 51200 (B2 III/IV). So it seems as though WR 6 may not be the only ionising star for this nebula.Avedisova includes Sh 2-303 = Bran 3 in the star formation region SFR 233.40-9.42 along with the smaller nebula Bran 1."
304,"According to a 1982 study, this nebula is ionised by the Wolf-Rayet star WR 6 (EZ CMa) along with Sh 2-304 and Sh 2-308. However, a look at this region in hydrogen-alpha suggests that Sh 2-304 lies at some distance from WR 6 and forms the brightest portion of a long ridge that lies below the large Gum 8 / Sh 2-310 HII region. The ridge may be ionised by the combined radiation from the many hot stars in this region."
305,"Sh 2-305 is ionised by at least two O-class stars ([VM75] Sh 2-305 4 (O8.5 V) and [VM75] Sh 2-305 2 (O9.5 V)), and possibly two B0 class stars as well. It contains the loose infrared cluster [DBS2003] 5.Avedisova places this nebula in star formation region SFR 233.75-0.18 along with 5 infrared sources, a water maser and the star cluster Mayer 3.A 1995 paper places Sh 2-299, Sh 2-300, Sh 2-305, Sh 2-306, Sh 2-307 and Sh 2-309 into the same giant molecular cloud complex. A 1996 paper places Sh 2-305 to Sh 2-309 into molecular cloud [JKK96] D within the enormous infrared ring called the GS234-02 supershell, in the Perseus arm.You can view the enormous dust ring around the supershell in this WISE infrared image. Sh 2-299 and Sh 2-300 also appear in this direction."
306,"Avedisova lists three ionising O-stars for this nebula, including the hot O5 V star LSS 458. The others are the O9 III giant LSS 499 and the O9.5 III giant LSS 467.A 1995 paper places Sh 2-299, Sh 2-300, Sh 2-305, Sh 2-306, Sh 2-307 and Sh 2-309 into the same giant molecular cloud complex.

307,"Avedisova lists the ionising stars as the O9 V BD -18 1920 and the B3 III giant LSS 566. Other sources also include the B0V star MFJ Sh 2-307 3. The nebula contains the infrared cluster candidate [DBS2003] 8.A 1995 paper places Sh 2-299, Sh 2-300, Sh 2-305, Sh 2-306, Sh 2-307 and Sh 2-309 into the same giant molecular cloud complex.

Sh 2-299 and Sh 2-300 also appear in this direction.Both Avedisova and a 2007 paper, however, give much closer distance estimates and thus appear to exclude this nebula from the supershell.You can view a good Dean Salman image of this nebula here."
308,"This ring nebula surrounds the Wolf-Rayet star WR 6 (EZ CMa), which is one of the closest Wolf-Rayet stars to our solar system and may also partially ionise Sh 2-303 and Sh 2-304.This distance to WR 6 is a matter of some controversy. The Hipparcos astrometric satellite results were used in 1997 to determine a parallax suggesting a distance of about 575 parsecs. However, other researchers strongly disagreed with this estimate and proposed distances of up to three times this amount.A revised Hipparcos analysis published in 2007 using the same data determined a very different parallax and a distance of about 1400 pc, much closer to other estimates.A striking narrow-band image here shows the strong ionised oxygen emission from Sh 2-308, which the photographer calls the Gourd nebula."
309,"Avedisova concludes that Sh 2-309 is ionised by the star cluster Bochum 6, including the O9 III giant LSS 499. She places it in star formation region SFR 234.76-0.20 along with the HII region Bran 42 and the emission star SS73 6.The nebula contains the loose infrared cluster [DBS2003] 9.A 1995 paper places Sh 2-299, Sh 2-300, Sh 2-305, Sh 2-306, Sh 2-307 and Sh 2-309 into the same giant molecular cloud complex. A 1996 paper places Sh 2-305 to Sh 2-309 into molecular cloud [JKK96] D within the enormous infrared ring called the GS234-02 supershell, in the Perseus arm.You can view the enormous dust ring around the supershell in this WISE infrared image. Sh 2-299 and Sh 2-300 also appear in this direction."
310,"This vast nebula, one of the largest single HII regions known in the Milky Way, is ionised by two multiple star systems (Tau Canis Majoris and UW Canis Majoris) each made up of several O-class stars. This image shows only the brightest part of the enormous Sh 2-310 complex. The intense radiation from the Tau Canis Majoris and UW Canis Majoris star systems has created a cavity in the molecular clouds at the centre of Sh 2-310, which is located beyond the upper right of the image.Avedisova places Sh 2-310 in the star formation region SFR 237.25-6.50 with 62 components, including 4 masers, 14 infrared sources and the dark nebulae LDN 1660 and LDN 1664.At least one scientific paper notes the ""arrow-shaped bright rim"" shown in this image. Perhaps Sh 2-310 should be known as the Arrowhead nebula?"
311,"NGC 2467, sometimes called the Mandrill nebula, is ionised by the ultrahot O3 V star HD 64568, the O6 IV subgiant HD 64315, and the B0 V star LSS 830, according to Avedisova. Besides the NGC 2467 star cluster itself, it includes the star clusters Haffner 18 and Haffner 19. The bright foreground star on the far left of the image is the B8 IV subgiant HD 64455.It lies in the direction of the Pup OB1 and Pup OB2 associations (which overlap in the sky).A good image of NGC 2467 is available in several resolutions from the European Southern Observatory. (Note: the ESO image is rotated 90 degrees, with north to the right.)"
312,"There is nothing much in the scientific literature about this object. BFS comments that it is ""Too large and diffuse for meaningful observations"". This image shows only a tiny fragment of a vast region of nebulosity. It is the fourth object in the Sharpless catalog by area of apparent sky covered. Perhaps it is a fragment of the even larger Gum nebula?"
313,"This is the planetary nebula Abell 35. Like Sh 2-52 (Abell 65), it has a highly unusual binary central star.You can see a much better image of this nebula on Dean Salman's Sharpless nebula image site."
