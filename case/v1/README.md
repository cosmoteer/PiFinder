# Version 1 parts

The current version for PiFinder case parts is version 2.  These parts are archived for reference/replacement.

## Insert Size
The build uses m2.5 threaded inserts, but there are two main types of these in general availability.  To support both of these types, there are two versions of all the pieces that require inserts.  These are stored in a `small_inserts` and `large_inserts` folder and you should only need one set.

See the images below to identify the type of insert you have.  They accept the same type of screw, but the outside diameters are slightly different.
